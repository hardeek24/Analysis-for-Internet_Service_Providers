You should get rid of the amp and trash it they are no longer used and block a lot of frequencies. Make sure there is a MoCa filter on the ground block outside.

Could you offer to put the account in your name instead? Since you are a network guy I’d recommend buying your own modem/router to save on the monthly equipment fee. That said you may just save as much money as possible and move out.

TV first moved to comcasts streaming service which was a good value but then the price went up substantially and now will probably move her to YouTube TV.  Now mobile is bumping up and probably makes sense to go to US Mobile.  So Xfinity will be left with her $10 per month internet essentials plan and the increased cost of her streaming now leaving their network.  At some point theyre going to have to realize theyre not a monopoly anymore at least not for most stuff.

Still in the box it came in.','I called to cut my cable w/Spectrum because I was moving to Youtube TV for streaming under their Basic Plan. The representative on the phone offered a similar plan/pricing using their Xumo streaming devices thru Spectrum. Since I was keeping their internet and mobile service anyway.....we had an hour-long conversation where he itemized a plan staying w/ Spectrum over the phone. I took my old cable box receivers back(3 of them) with the remotes to end the cable service(it was the last day in my billing cycle). I then picked up (2) Xumo streaming boxes at the local Spectrum store while turning in the old cable equipment. When I got back home I hooked them both up went online to activate the streaming service and had to leave my credit card information for establishing the account. Then I received an email within an hour that showed the new service charges and summary of my new service. It was not only ridiculously high but nothing close to what was represented during that hour-long phone conversation. The entire purpose of cutting out the cable was to save $$ by streaming. My Youtube plan plus keeping the Spectrum internet would come to roughly $115......Spectrum new service which was not even comparable to the channels Youtubes plan offered ended up being $217. I immediately called Spectrum was tossed around to 3 different representatives....the last one being a supervisor and was basically stonewalled even after informing her Fraud and Misrepresentation had occurred and I would be returning their equipment the next morning. IF they attempt to charge me the $217 I will bring suit against Spectrum for Fraud Misrepresentation and all attached grievances I have suffered as a result of simply attempting to quit their cable service. I guess that first representative that switched me over to Spectrums Xumo receivers and streaming totally lied to me for a commission. Regardless I reboxed the equipment and will be returning it first thing in the morning. All of the conversations are recorded if I am forced to file suit. Total total Fraud was explicitly and by design committed against me......Spectrum is 100% liable and guilty.  The moral of the story is that I would no longer recommend doing any business w/Spectrum or any of its entities. They cannot be trusted and will use tactics against their customers.  There is so much more to this story.....including previous phone calls and other episodes in the 3 yrs I was their customer. Youtube TV is now my new server for streaming and this Fraud debacle w/Spectrum is pending a final outcome.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1asln4d/the_xumo_box_is_a_scam_15_activation_fee_still_in/kx8cy8d/'

I’ve run a household of 6 on 6mbit 40mbit 100mbit 500mbit and 1000mbit. At 6 it’s difficult to stream video on multiple endpoints if I do - the quality automatically lowers quite a bit. Latency gaming is high unless no one is doing anything. At 40mbit that problem is almost gone with occasional jumps in ping. At 100 and above I’d say ‘it depends’.   At the end of the day Comcast offers at most (at least in my ‘market’) 35mbit upload - and with more and more users Uploading things (dropbox/tiktok uploads/Snapchat uploads/work from home where files are uploaded/iCloud backup uploads) this is likely to be a bottleneck at some point in your future no matter what plan you get.   Fiber options are usually symmetric (same upload / download speeds).  I like to start small - then work my way up.

In the event that you decide to rent our gateway this would allow for a whole home Wi-Fi evaluation. Whole Home Wi-Fi evaluates your network performance to help ensure the most Wi-Fi coverage throughout the home.   You should connect all your WiFi-enabled devices as soon as possible following activation of your xFi Gateway. If youre an existing customer who signs up for xFi Complete but currently has an ineligible Gateway youll be sent an eligible xFi Gateway. The evaluation will begin when the new xFi Gateway is activated. You’ll receive an email highlighting the benefits of xFi Complete and notifying you that the Whole Home WiFi evaluation has begun within one day of activating the Gateway.  After the initial 14-day assessment period you’ll receive additional emails with information about your xFi network performance. You may receive recommendations to further optimize your network. After the Whole Home evaluation is complete the results are sent to the primary email address on file. Depending on the results you’ll receive one of two emails indicating:  Email One: Your coverage is looking great or Email Two: You can improve your home Wi-Fi coverage with an WiFi Boost Pod  Note: If you receive this email youre eligible to receive an Wi-Fi Boost Pod at no additional cost.  The Wi-Fi Boost Pod must be redeemed using the link in the email and will be shipped within five to seven business days of redemption. The same online order link will be available in xFis Notification Center and the Wi-Fi Boost Pod Redemption tile in the Overview tab of the Xfinity app.  Six-Month Checkup:   If you are not recommended for an Wi-Fi Boost Pod you’ll receive another evaluation every six months for 24 months or until you receive an email indicating that you may benefit from an Wi-Fi Boost Pod.  Note: Well only send an email if we determine you can benefit from an Wi-Fi Boost Pod.   We hope this information helps. Please let us know if you have additional questions!','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1brljq2/xfi_complete_are_pods_included_or_cost_extra/kx9t39b/'

Help!','UPDATE:  Although the Xfinity team here was willing to engage with me the reality is that its completely impractical to work out the issue by going back and forth at irregular intervals -- especially where you want to cut to the chase.  I ended up speaking to a phone rep who gave me the following plan:  1 GB internet and Ultimate TV package (without Max and Paramount+ for which I had been paying $5 each/month) and two cable cards for $216.23 for one year.  Additionally I agreed to port my landline over to mobile -- with Xfinity giving me a free Samsung A3 -- which would result in an additional $45/month savings when set up (I still have not received the phone after three days...).  With auto-billing I should get an additional $10/month savings.  If this all pans out (and I am still waiting to find out -- if it doesnt I will pitch an absolute fit and indeed cancel) I should be at roughly $161/month.  The whole endeavor took about 90 minutes by phone and significant discussion when the rep tried to get me to sign off on things that werent accurate -- not an endeavor for the faint of heart...','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bn2bpz/xfinity_price_spike_help/kxagxv6/'

Instructions vary by Windows version but if you go to Settings Network and Internet and select your Ethernet connection then change Adapter Options Double Click on your Network Adapter Select Properties and make sure Internet Protocol Version 4 is checked. Close all windows. Verify PC has a local LAN IP (10.0.0.x or 192.168.x.x 172.x depends on how the gateway is configured). IPv4 connectivity will say Internet is IPv4 is enabled and working properly.   Failing that the only other thing I can think to do is a factory reset on the gateway then reactivate it using the Xfinity app which will force a re-provision and hopefully clear out any cobwebs on the backend. Leave the PC unplugged from the gateway while you do this. Do not transfer settings in the Xfinity app if it asks set up everything from scratch.   Or you can put the Gateway into Bridge Mode and plug your PC into your Decos LAN. Then take care of the port forwarding for Minecraft on the Deco router instead. You will lose the Wi-Fi network that is being broadcasted from the gateway if you do this but if you only using your mesh for Wi-Fi anyway then it will not matter.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1brsf22/help_colossal_issues_with_port_forwarding/kxb8i73/'

The packages that people used to have and that kind of pricing are long gone. Sometimes downgrading can even cost more money.  Your best bet is going to be if you have a second adult living in the house cancel all services and sign up as a new customer in the other person’s name. It may be the only way you’re going to save money.   The other types of people that seem to always save money with this are ones that stuck to Internet only from the beginning  .  My brother has done that since 2018.  He always reaches out to the reps on Twitter official reps and he renews his Internet for somewhere between $40-$50 a month and they lock it in for a year or two.  If I was doing business with this company I would never get anything more than Internet.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1br4c6e/downgrade_question_will_i_really_only_save_12month/kxbhrgk/'

Maybe in addition to data caps theyre implementing maximum file transfer size seems every time they increase speeds they add restrictions to prevent you from using the increase.  Hopefully that is not the case and it is some buggy behavior of the new router (firewalls can but typically do not send a RST so hopefully a firmware update will fix it).

','Youll want to set up a wired device with a continuous ping to something like google and watch to see if there is packet loss or latency spikes.  Is your gaming system hardwired to the router?  There are freeware apps like pingplotter that can make a nice graph for you too.  The last straw when I left comcast was severe packet loss due a power line laying on their wires and they said it would be months before the power company would get around to fixing it.  Old copper cabling is very susceptible to interference.  It is possible whatever caused the outage wasnt totally fixed.  I had to prove beyond a doubt I actually do a lot of network monitoring and reporting so it was easy for me to set up a 24x7 ping and graph the latency and packet loss once they saw that they could not deny anything and thats when they finally admitted to the power line thing.  But the other possibility as I alluded to is it could be wifi problems if you arent hardwired so you do need to at least narrow down if the issue is on the LAN or WAN.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bs001j/anybody_else_have_online_gaming_issues_with/kxcm2if/'

But even if that isnt your current problem Id see if it is possible to get a permanent hardwire (they make flat cable in different colors that can be run along baseboards or fishing normal cable through walls isnt always as a bad as it sounds if you have an unfinished basement or attic).  Serious gaming should be hardwired only.  Not only will it give you lower consistent latency without fluctuations for interference or other people using it but most likely new games/updates will download much faster (depending on how fast your internet plan is often the wifi speed is the bottleneck).  Understood it isnt always possible but worth giving some thought to.  If not possible then a long temporary cable just for testing to see if the problems go away or not will help tell if it is wifi related.  Another thing you can do without much effort at all is use the xfinity app to do a speed test to your modem.  That tests your WAN connection.  If there is packet loss or even high latency on their end speed will usually be significantly lower than what you should be getting.','kxcok2y','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bs001j/anybody_else_have_online_gaming_issues_with/kxcpmgj/'

Citing folks who have actually worked there and one that currently does I am told they actively make it this way. They want you in debt to them they want you to never cancel because its such a hassle. They are a monopoly so they can be as anti-consumer as they want. They are acting against your best interests pretty much all the time because we literally have no other choice based on where we live. They are essentially an arm of the government at this point closely collaborating with data collection firms government entities committing outright fraud (they have been caught many times doing this) and operate with impunity. No one goes to jail no ones is held accountable its basically as movie level evil as it gets 😂 from my personal experience and the experiences of insiders unfortunately this is how it works.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bruyg4/confusing_website/kxcpxs1/'

','u/East_Emu_889 well that is certainly good to hear would you say the skill gap to entry for a new player is relatively manageable? As far as learning mechanics in order to get started.  Okay that definitely helps us narrow a couple of things down but one thing I would like to take a look at is the current plan you have to see what kind of speeds you are potentially working with while connected. I know that you mentioned your connection has been wireless to this point and there is usually a significant difference on connectivity in comparison to a hardwired connection. Especially if the modem is located in an area of the home that is not relatively close to your console or if there are potential points of interference such as a brick infrastructure or a microwave.  Are you aware of which GHz band you are connecting to? If not no worries as this is something we can look a bit deeper into later.','kxcotep','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bs001j/anybody_else_have_online_gaming_issues_with/kxcqgxc/'

This morning I reactivate the CODA56 cable modem that worked fine with 200mbps upload prior to replacement with the CM3000. It is now also stuck below 100mbps.

Im sorry to hear youre having still issues with your service but you have definitely come to the right place for assistance.  It sounds like the technician identified an issue was happening outside your home in the service lines. When this happens the technician will usually create a maintenance referral ticket to have the lines investigated. If your visit happened a week ago the maintenance referral may have already occurred but if your issues were not resolved we will need to get someone else out there to investigate.  If you could please send me a [Modmail message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Comcast_Xfinity) and include your full name the name on the account (if different) and the service address associated with your account Id be more than happy to look into this for you.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bsg95e/how_to_actually_get_your_net_fixed/kxfehl2/'

If you werent sure you were talking to an actual Comcast tech you should hang up.  If you were sure you were talking to a Comcast tech then they can look up your IMEI in the system as it is a required piece of info to make your phone work.  My guess is they wanted to verify that the IMEI on the phone you were using matched what was listed in their system as part of their troubleshooting.  Refusing to tell them your IMEI is like refusing to provide a bank teller your account number.  They can still look it up just takes them a little more time.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bsj7ca/xfinity_mobile_service_member_insisting_they/kxg1nb5/'

It really helps us understand your LAN concerns. Based on the info and the image I think getting a third-party network switch could solve your issues. You can find different options depending on how many ports you need. Unfortunately we cant help with the WAPs but I suggest reaching out to the device manufacturer if they dont work properly after getting the network switch.  I recommend getting a network switch plugging it into port 1 and then connecting all the Ethernet cables WAPs and devices to any available port on the switch. Leave the modem where it is as its set up at the fiber line termination point. This should help activate all the WAPs and devices in your home. Can you give this a try and update your post once everything is connected? Thanks!','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bsl146/new_fiber_customer_questions/kxgfm87/'

The reps you spoke to were correct unfortunately. The information we have states  “Existing BTG customers:  All existing BTG customers (on fourth generation or earlier plans) will see a price increase to: $20 for 1GB/ Shared Data $35/mo for 3GB Shared Data $65/mo for 10 GB Shared Data  If an existing customer goes over the data on their selected plan they’ll pay $20 per additional GB used.   Examples:  An existing first generation customer on a 1 GB shared data plan will see a price increase from $12 to $20/GB and if they use an additional two GBs in a month they will pay $60 ($20 + $40 for 2 GB over).    An existing customer on a 3GB shared data plan can choose to stay on their legacy plan and pay $35/mo but if they use an additional 1 GB they’ll pay $55 ($35 + $20 for 1 GB over).”','kxeio8n','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bry2bn/xfinity_mobile_prorated_refund_when_leaving_xm/kxgwy47/'

It even uses winget to install so thats a bonus.  So I extracted the UserName and UserPassword fields in XFINITY.mobileconfig. Turns out the username and password are the same ones that the Xfinity iOS app inserted in to my wi-fi settings when I installed the iOS version of the profile on my iPhone.  I guess that Comcast doesnt issue new username and password strings for each new iOS or macOS device you add it to. I didnt try using that username and password I extracted from iOS in any of the other OSs I tried or the travel router I used because I thought they were unique to that device. But I guess not.  In the meantime I can confirm that my GL-iNet GL-AXT1800 travel router took the settings fine when I replaced my username of [usernamehere@comcast.net](mailto:usernamehere@comcast.net) and Comcast account password with what appears in those UserName and UserPassword fields of XFINITY.mobileconfig.  The only known unknown I can think of now is whether or not the username and password from XFINITY.mobileconfig change when one resets their Comcast account password.

It’s not just wifi but also the firewall and router for the home.  So keep it wired as shown then you can run a network cable from port 1 down to the switch than connect everything else to the switch.  If you want to relocate it to another room you will still need to connect it in between the fiber box and the switch so you will need two network cables run to that location.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bsl146/new_fiber_customer_questions/kxhu1at/'

A restart is different than a factory reset. A factory reset restores your gateway to its original default settings including your WiFi name and password. If prompted you’ll be required to create a custom WiFi name and password and reconnect devices to your home network using this information. To manually restore factory settings follow the following steps depending on your gateway model.  Locate the Reset button on the back of the gateway and use a non-metallic pointed object (such as a toothpick) to hold in the Reset button for 30 seconds until all the LED lights power off. If your gateway does not have a Reset button locate the WPS button and hold it for 30 seconds.','kx10n1a','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bpo8cm/xfinity_app_wont_let_me_change_wifi_network_name/kx12ayw/'

I tried to deal with Comcast but couldnt so I moved to Astound for my internet however Astound does all IPTV so I couldnt get a cable card to use my Tivo so I only have Astounds internet.  When I first got it I was worried since I couldnt get the upload speeds (have their 1500 / 50 Mbps package).  The tech first said it was my modem (Arris SB8200) but I knew that wasnt it.  Over three days they had four different crews working on the lines and did finally correct their issue.  So far its been working great and the speeds are better than what I was getting with Comcast since Comcast hasnt approved the SB8200 for their higher upload speeds yet.  Overall I am happy with the internet cant beat Free installation 1 month free and 6 months for $20 ($32.97 with taxes & fees).  Ill see what happens in six months.  I hope I dont have to move again because their customer service and technicians were excellent!','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bq89sp/insane_50_price_increase/kx12nzh/'

I recently had a similar issue with Xfinity.        • On 2/2/2024 I noticed that my paperless billing through EcoBill had reset.    • Texted with a Comcast Xfinity representative who helped me reassert the paperless billing.    • The same Comcast Xfinity representative then offered to save me money by adding Xfinity mobile.    • I told the Comcast Xfinity representative that I was under contract with T-Mobile.    • The Comcast Xfinity representative then stated that my phones were compatible.    • The Comcast Xfinity representative then stated that my phones were unlocked.    • The Comcast Xfinity representative then stated that I could keep my current Internet plan.    • Based on what ended up being misinformation delivered by Xfinity representative I consented to the addition of a mobile plan.    • I soon discovered that my phones were locked and I had to cancel the mobile plan.    • Because I consented to adding the mobile plan I lost my original Internet plan.    • The plan that replaced it was more expensive. Comcast Xfinity refused to reinstate my former price.        You are not alone. Thank you for sharing your experience.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bwucgz/xfinity_attempted_fraud/kyarntm/'

Comcast has a long record of using anti consumer practices and I dont put it past them to make the site frustrating to use to make people fed up and just want to pay the bill and get it over with instead of taking their time making sure they arent being ripped off or scammed with hidden charges.   Its highly suspect that the site suddenly encounters issues whenever I try to inspect my bills compared to previous months..

Excuse the wordiness.  He found nothing specifically wrong but out of an abundance of caution replaced everything he could from where the cable comes into the house all the way to the box at the property line including removing an un-needed splitter and running a new service cable which he says will need to be buried by a different crew. **Not happy** about having my yard dug up but hopefully its a non-invasive process and I realize there are advantages to having as many new pieces as possible for overall quality of service. I will note that at my modem (Motorola 7621) signal levels now show *worse* than before his changes with downstream power levels hovering around 8 to 9 when they were 3 to 5 beforehand. As long as the service works I dont care what the numbers are but I figured it was worth mentioning.  Ill also note that a neighbor down the street happened to walk by when the tech was here and asked if I had been having problems with my internet the last couple days and indicated she had too the same problems I have. So again while I dont mind getting all-new connectors and cables and things I remain convinced this is an upstream problem.  The last time I experienced the problem I described in my original message was all yesterday evening its been smooth sailing today both before and after the tech has been here so its hard to say whether the changes fixed anything but Ill post if the problem happens again. Also thinking of swapping out my modem for an Arris S33 just to remove another variable (the 7621 has been a workhorse but I realize its pretty old at this point).  I welcome any additional thoughts or sleuthing you all might have.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bwoart/maddening_periodic_connectivity_problems_last_24/kycbse4/'

Most recently I did renegotiate a contract here with the Mods. Even then I had to keep tabs on what was promised and until I saw a contract with exactly what we had discussed I didnt go forward. They did really help me so no complaints here! It took about a week for some reason which I attributed to having multiple people involved in responding after reading the other Mods notes. I would not be inclined to take a call from anyone from Xfinity as they seemed to have gotten so far away from the customers needs and wishes. In answer to your question it seems like straight up fraud. Maybe make a report with your states consumer agency about this?','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bwucgz/xfinity_attempted_fraud/kycchk2/'

The only option for unlimited that’s listed is their xFi product but that won’t allow for your own modem. Call or chat with them and be specific about what you want. I ended up on a chat session and they pushed the xFi bit super hard going so far as to have it in my cart and encouraging me to complete the checkout process. I pushed back re-stating what I wanted and they sent me a link to a cart attached to my current account with the unlimited data add on for $30/month no xFi my own modem.  It’s definitely a thing that’s offered. I don’t feel like my interaction was a misunderstanding of what I wanted. I just think it was the hard sell. Double check what you’re sent before competing the process but it can be done.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bxmd2i/went_through_at_least_600gb_of_data_cap_overnight/kye5d1f/'

The 1st time was a freebie and the other times it cost me $10 (each time for 50 gig extra) so Im out a total of $20 for 5 years. The unlimited plan is an extra $50/mo so Im $2980 ahead of the game.

I was trying to reduce the cost of my service and communicated with several different agents through Twitter. The packages I found on their site (probably the same ones you found) are offered to new customers only. I thought I could drop my premium channels but it turns out they’re part of the Gigabit package and if I drop them I have to enter into a new 12-month contract with an early termination fee. I’m moving out of state later this year and didn’t want to do that so I’m not sure what my options are  I talked to them about canceling my TV subscription and just keeping the internet but then I’d have to return all their equipment to them. When I asked if they really expected me to remove all the cables attached to my basement rafters and bring them in they didn’t answer that question. I could easily return the cable boxes but there’s a lot more equipment in my house than just the boxes. For the time being I’m just leaving things as they are.','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bxqi7w/contract_ended_and_chat_and_phone_reps_are/kyey7tu/'

If possible the tech would have put a temp line on the ground to give service now while waiting for the bury crew to install your underground line.  However if the temp line would cross roads sidewalks driveways or other people’s property then they cannot put a temp line down.  In that case the only thing that can be done is wait for the underground line to be installed and then have an install set up for as soon as possible after that.  They don’t run coax to every house built because why spend money running lines for people who may never be customers?  They only run to structures with customers.  Which they will do for you but unfortunately they can only get to them as fast as the manpower to do so.

When I originally signed up adding a phone ended up being cheaper than just cable & internet. Looking online at the breakdown of my offers having a phone included in the bundle is net -$16.00. However the process of trying to go through phone options and add-ons breaks check-out and I am prompted to call so I am not able to see that bundle through to the end  My guess would be that they want you to have more services initially so when discounts expire they have multiple areas to raise prices.

Thank you for taking a moment out of your busy day to leave a post on our community subreddit. Im sorry to hear youre having issues with your connection but you have definitely come to the right place for assistance.  Im happy to hear you already have a technician scheduled for this but it wouldnt hurt to go through a little standard troubleshooting ahead of time just in case. Are you seeing these latency spikes with other content or while connecting to other game servers besides the one you mentioned? Have you already tried running a traceroute to the Ubisoft server to see if the latency is happening closer to you or closer to the destination? It may be helpful to the technician if you can identify a specific relay point or hop where things are consistently breaking down. You can find more details about this in our [Troubleshooting Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast_Xfinity/wiki/knowledgebase/troubleshooting/internet-checklist/#wiki_1._is_there_a_service_interruption_impacting_you.3F).','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1by33vv/ping_spikeslatency_issues_on_ps5_xfinity_comcast/kygmb5g/'

One of the things I also hate with cable tv is the amount of fees tacked on and they keep inching up in price almost every year.    Yeah I cut the cable cord quite some time ago as have many folks I know have too and use streaming services — variety to choose from full blown packages like YouTube TV to smaller packages like Sling.    Between the different reps what price was quoted if you went with Internet only service?    My promo plan is $70 for 800 Mbps Internet but ending this summer and so I’ll be jumping thru this game soon.    I don’t expect to get that same deal but expecting some price increase - I want to keep my costs down and so I’d be ok to step down to 400 Mbps speed at a reasonable cost.

'kyhbgr9','2024-04-07 08:29:17','Geeky_1','1bxqi7w','Contract Ended and chat and phone reps are unhelpful. ','My 2-year contract ended last sunmer and they wont offer any more 2 year contracts. Cost jumped $50 then they had a $25 increase in January so it went from $125 to almost $200 just for 1 DVR/TV. Ridulous as Ive been a customer for 20 years. Since TVs in all my other rooms are antenna only Im going to go to antenna on my living room TV as well and try out streaming. I only need a DVR as I time-shift everything except news and local NFL which are OTA. The only thing I really watch on cable is F1 and FIS World Cup skiing isnt even on cable anymore but available for $10/month streaming. F1 streaming is available for $10/month or $85/year which works out to only $7/month. So I can reduce my bill from $209 to $83 Comcast Internet only (300 MB) with antenna and streaming. Tivo no longer stock their OTA DVRs $500 but I found Tablo OTA DVR for only $99 with no subscription fee. Tablo offers a $20 referral ($20 off for you and theyll send me a $20 gift certificate). I dont know if you can PM on Reddit but I would just need an email to send referral code.  https://www.tablotv.com/refer-a-friend/?utm_source=Klaviyo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Refer_A_Friend_Announcement_4th_Gen_Customers_Feb_22_2024%20clone%20clone&_kx=JLIbTD8x0DmZJjnhZ-9KUNo6fejDofb033eqFyTK64E.X86ZE8  https://www.formula1.com/en-us/subscribe-to-f1-tv','kygyz0c','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bxqi7w/contract_ended_and_chat_and_phone_reps_are/kyhbgr9/'

I use the devices at different times but there’s 10+ (some are Home IoT devices).  In an ideal world if it brought down the cost I’d go Internet only as I mainly watch Twitch & YouTube occasionally but I’ve never seen any higher speed plans that allow that. So I guess if there has to be a TV plan added to get a cheaper rate whatever the most basic one without the Kids/News/etc. add-ons that drive up the price.','kyhlfen','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1by746h/trying_to_adjust_plan_details_web_interface/kyhmtbe/'

And when I do need to see something detailed like a chart or graph then Ill switch to 4k temporarily since its easy to do.  Same with the movie streaming do you need to watch every movie in 4K ultra HDR?  Especially if its something running in the background?

'kyj7wgn','2024-04-07 15:13:34','bryanus','1bx0v41','Why is my unlocked pixel 4xl ineligible for xfinity mobile?','I have a similat issue with a Google Fi (unlocked) pixel 5. The BYOD imei checker says it is not compatible and also chat/phone support and even escalated support days the same. The issue is that for some stupid reason some unlocked Pixels were not whitelisted to whatever database exists that xfinity checks against to allow/provision a device on their network. This is apparently the same database that all Verizon-based carriers use so I cant pass the IMEI check for any of them. If I try to put in an xfinity sim card I wont get service. The only Verizon-based carrier I have found that works is US mobile with physical sim card and using a fake imei to sign up.  It sounds like youre 4xl may be in the same boat. Theres nothing you can do as no one can get the device whitelisted. If you have the ability to return it to the I amazon do so asap. And if you buy another one immediately check the BYOD imei checker to see if it can be used or not. Its really an edge case but definitely affects some Pixels out there. For mine Im hoping to trade it in at some point as I cant really sell it as fully unlocked. Good luck!','-','/r/Comcast_Xfinity/comments/1bx0v41/why_is_my_unlocked_pixel_4xl_ineligible_for/kyj7wgn/'

A few days later I contacted HBO and they say there is nothing they can do since the account online shows billed through Xfinity.  Surprise surprise Im checking now and Xfinity still comes up as the biller.  The difference between us though is that my billing cycle doesnt end for three more days.    Because of your poor experience I will not continue to insist through either Xfinity or HBO.  I took screenshots of the account and am going to start a new account with new email and meticulously put back the profile of the moocher on my account (I only use it to watch Curb).

I understand you have tried to update this option a few times but here are all the steps so you can start from the beginning of the process.  To set up downtime on the Xfinity Mobile app follow these steps:  1. Open the Xfinity Mobile app on your device. 2. Go to the persons Settings page. 3. Select Create Schedule next to Downtime. 4. Choose the type of schedule you want to set (e.g. Anytime Bedtime Homework Dinner). 5. Give the schedule a name. 6. Select the days on which the schedule should apply. 7. Set the start and end times for the schedule. 8. Click Apply to save the schedule.  Note that schedules cannot overlap and there must be at least one minute between the end of one schedule and the beginning of the next.
