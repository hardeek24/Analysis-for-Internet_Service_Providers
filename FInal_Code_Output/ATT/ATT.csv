If you wanna use eSIM you have to give them IMEI and tell them you wanna use eSIM out of country and they will do carrier visibility. It just doesn‚Äôt see other carriers on eSim for that model. But physical slot is already unlocked. Just go to tmobile store if they already lit up a number for iPad tell them to swap the number to physical sim and give it you on spot.

'kxifu7e','2024-04-01 00:04:07','-DetroitLions-','1bsjedn','Thanks for the data breach ATT!','Any device can use a SIM lock without any system/account requirement from AT&T. That‚Äôs been the case since SIM cards have been in existence. That would stop someone from SIM swapping and isn‚Äôt device/carrier specific.  For example on an iPhone:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/118228  That is not new and typically customers don‚Äôt care enough to use these types of methods then place blame elsewhere.  While I agree there could have been more in place on the account level such as number locking for port outs that is not an AT&T only security concern.  I use to work for T-Mobile and had customers get their number ported WITH a number transfer PIN required and no SIM swapping. It‚Äôs possible to do so on any carrier regardless of methods used unless there was 100% no digital verification and it required in person ID. Then again someone could go through the lengths to create a fake ID and gain access as well. There‚Äôs no completely infallible method.  Even today someone could get a phone reset a password via text bypass any MFA login to an online account and port numbers in less than 2mins if they really want to. I would not say that is on the carrier specifically.  I also wouldn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs because the company doesn‚Äôt care about security. Those are individual case issues that have been industry trends over the past 5-10yrs. No company even used NTPs or number locks before that.','kxibauj','/r/ATT/comments/1bsjedn/thanks_for_the_data_breach_att/kxifu7e/'

But that wasnt the determining factor. There are two big problems with Netgear:  1. Battery life: M6 Pro charges for 5 hours and lasts 8 hours the A50 charges for 3 hours and lasts 24 hours. 2. Performance: Reddit is filled with anecdotal reports of abysmal 5G reception with users swapping units to no end and AT&T and Netgear trying to blame each other.  The A50 has good feedback and its faster to charge and much more energy efficient. Both support n77. The only difference between them is that A50 has Qcom X62 and M6 has X65.  The only difference between those is that the M6 Pro/X65 adds the n29 band. AT&T is supposed to be using that but CellMapper doesnt even have it in the dropdown. They seem to be almost entirely n77.  It didnt make sense to sacrifice 2/3rds battery life and proven performance for n29 but let me know if I should take another look.','kxj66z2','/r/ATT/comments/1bpix6c/is_it_typical_to_get_5g_speeds_that_are_roughly/kxkcd5p/'

If its your literal next door neighbor you can have an address validation ticket put it to green light your house for fiber. This type of ticket is done when a house was missed in the system for saying its available.  Now if you mean a block or two away or a street or two away it is not simple at all. In cases like that it means they almost definitely feed out of a different neighborhood box than you and yours hasnt been upgraded to fiber yet. Expanding fiber to your street would require a full fiber buildout of that neighborhood box meaning replacing the neighborhood box and running new fiber down every street it feeds. While that doesnt mean it wont eventually happen it isnt as simple as just extending it from the existing fiber as each neighborhood box feeds a specific area and isnt designed to expand into areas covered by other boxes.  In the end unless your next door neighbor has it but you dont all you can really do is wait until they upgrade your neighborhood box. There is no rhyme or reason to how they decide to upgrade areas and right now there is a hold on build out in some areas until more of the already ran fiber has more customers sign up/convert over to it.','-','/r/ATT/comments/1btcml7/any_way_to_get_fiber_at_my_address_all/kxl9s1l/'

In May 2023 I went to a barely 1000 people concert in Moore Theatre (Downtown) and absolutely nothing loaded on data the entire concert with T-Mobile 5G UC. I do know a lot of Seattle people use T-Mobile due to the presence of their HQ in Bellevue. To be honest it was the T-Mobile trial which should have full priority. Verizon at least had working but slow LTE. T-Mobile 5G UC was slightly faster than Verizon 5G UW at my hotel near the convention centre though.   Sadly my experience with T-Mobile since 2018 (SoCal) is always unreliable and failing me in the oddest places (if not rural/suburban coverage its places like hospitals with no service)   Verizon 5G UW was good throughout downtown Seattle (Capitol Hill) and SeaTac airport but oddly enough a lot of LTE-only not 5G areas in 2023... Found it odd that Verizon would not deploy 5G in airport areas due to their voluntary C-band ban at the time.   Unfortunately didnt use AT&T while in Seattle. Verizon does rank #1 in Seattle according to Rootmetrics reports.

AT&T has showier tower density in Dallas proper and more sites are being upgraded to have n77 and around 8 sites in the DFW market have DoD panels installed in addition to the regular n77 panel setup and they are heavily densifying the DFW Market. AT&T should upgrade the DAS at DFW Airport since their DAS is band 2/5/12 only and only Terminal D/E has good speed on AT&T doing over 120+ Mbps since Terminal C is slow on AT&T doing less than 5 Mbps due to having a old indoor DAS and T-Mobile has 5GUC all over the metroplex and every tower has it now.

If you‚Äôre worried that your device has fallen into the wrong hands you may want to initiate a remote wipe to delete your personal data and restore your device to it‚Äôs factory settings. Note that Find My iPhone will continue to display your customised message even after the device has been erased. And if you do retrieve your device you can restore it from your iCloud backup.  Removing a device is easy when you delink the device. This process is as simple as turning off the switch from Settings ‚Üí iCloud.  But if you do want to completely remove the device from your iCloud account follow the steps below:  Open a browser and go to http://icloud.com Sign in to your account Click on ‚ÄúFind My iPhone‚Äù Click on All Devices and then select the device you want to remove Click on ‚ÄúRemove from Account‚Äù This will remove the device from your account.','kynu3ul','/r/ATT/comments/1bz612n/need_help_att_is_saying_they_cant_set_up_my_new/kynvfw4/'

'kyp95n0','2024-04-08 17:47:06','ATTHelp','1bynvyk','Removing primary account holder','Hi u/Hamilton-64! We understand that you‚Äôre dealing with a challenging situation regarding the removal of primary account holder from your AT&T account. Let‚Äôs explore the steps you can take to address this:  Transfer of Billing Responsibility (TOBR):  As the primary account holder you have the authority to manage the account. However if you want to remove your ex-husband from the account you‚Äôll need to initiate a Transfer of Billing Responsibility (TOBR). The TOBR process allows someone else to assume responsibility for the account. You can authorize another person (such as a family member or friend) to take over the phone lines into their own name. Keep in mind that even after the transfer you remain ultimately responsible for any charges and services incurred while the account was in your name. To proceed with a TOBR you‚Äôll need to fill out the necessary forms and submit them to AT&T. They will review the request and decide whether to approve it.  Accessing the Account: Before initiating any changes you‚Äôll need to access your account. If you don‚Äôt currently have access consider the following steps: Recover Account Access: If you‚Äôve lost access to your account try recovering it through AT&T‚Äôs online portal.  Visit an AT&T Store: Since your ex-husband is unavailable visit an AT&T store in person. Explain your situation to the staff and provide any relevant legal documentation (such as the court order) to prove your status as the primary account holder. Once you regain access proceed with the TOBR process or explore other options.  Cancellation of the Account: If you no longer wish to maintain the account you have the right to cancel it. However this decision should be made carefully considering any ongoing services or contracts.  To cancel the account follow these steps: Access the Account: As mentioned earlier regain access to your account. Settle Outstanding Charges: Ensure that any outstanding bills are settled before closing the account ( if any).

A year ago even though deprioritized I would have gone with the Value Plus plan just so I could use an Apple Watch.  But the plan had a hard limit of 1 line.  So no smart watch.  I ended up putting my primary line on Visible+ which started to support the Watch for a then price of only $5/month.    Now due to the way I manage my 2 lines (both ATT Prepaid and Visible) to get coverage on both networks I cant change my mind since the ATT plan is on the annual plan.  11 months before it runs out.','kyp65ir','/r/ATT/comments/1bzb86c/do_you_need_a_credit_check_for_the_att_value_plus/kyp9kwv/'

The process you need to do is called Transfer Of Billing Responsibility or as we call it TOBR and it has 2 ways that can be done by. either that the PAH of the old account and you are at the store together with your IDs to complete the process Or you can just do it online and its way easier for you this way if you have access to the myat&t app for the account thats under his name. if so.. itll save you so much time and hustle if you can complete it online.. you can just log into the account initiate the process online and then accept it and create the new account and take your phone numbers/installments/plans/ features all in one go... you can do it on att.com/tobr','-','/r/ATT/comments/1bynvyk/removing_primary_account_holder/kyp9vx5/'

I was dispatched to houses that were getting installed with internet/tv. Most of the time they had a different wireless carrier. I was to assist them with the app setups while asking lifestyle questions. Then make offers with our wireless and promotions. We had better offers than any other part of the company. You‚Äôll have sales quotas. It involved a lot of follow-up and funnel managing. IHX gets a bad rap from other areas in the company due to reps not following up after the sale. If you get hired on be a good rep after the sale to your customers. It will pay dividends in referrals.','-','/r/ATT/comments/1bzea76/ihxfield_sales_rep_job_experience_description/kypa46f/'

'kxifu7e','2024-04-01 00:04:07','-DetroitLions-','1bsjedn','Thanks for the data breach ATT!','Any device can use a SIM lock without any system/account requirement from AT&T. That‚Äôs been the case since SIM cards have been in existence. That would stop someone from SIM swapping and isn‚Äôt device/carrier specific.  For example on an iPhone:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/118228  That is not new and typically customers don‚Äôt care enough to use these types of methods then place blame elsewhere.  While I agree there could have been more in place on the account level such as number locking for port outs that is not an AT&T only security concern.  I use to work for T-Mobile and had customers get their number ported WITH a number transfer PIN required and no SIM swapping. It‚Äôs possible to do so on any carrier regardless of methods used unless there was 100% no digital verification and it required in person ID. Then again someone could go through the lengths to create a fake ID and gain access as well. There‚Äôs no completely infallible method.  Even today someone could get a phone reset a password via text bypass any MFA login to an online account and port numbers in less than 2mins if they really want to. I would not say that is on the carrier specifically.  I also wouldn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs because the company doesn‚Äôt care about security. Those are individual case issues that have been industry trends over the past 5-10yrs. No company even used NTPs or number locks before that.','kxibauj','/r/ATT/comments/1bsjedn/thanks_for_the_data_breach_att/kxifu7e/'

But that wasnt the determining factor. There are two big problems with Netgear:  1. Battery life: M6 Pro charges for 5 hours and lasts 8 hours the A50 charges for 3 hours and lasts 24 hours. 2. Performance: Reddit is filled with anecdotal reports of abysmal 5G reception with users swapping units to no end and AT&T and Netgear trying to blame each other.  The A50 has good feedback and its faster to charge and much more energy efficient. Both support n77. The only difference between them is that A50 has Qcom X62 and M6 has X65.  The only difference between those is that the M6 Pro/X65 adds the n29 band. AT&T is supposed to be using that but CellMapper doesnt even have it in the dropdown. They seem to be almost entirely n77.  It didnt make sense to sacrifice 2/3rds battery life and proven performance for n29 but let me know if I should take another look.','kxj66z2','/r/ATT/comments/1bpix6c/is_it_typical_to_get_5g_speeds_that_are_roughly/kxkcd5p/'

If its your literal next door neighbor you can have an address validation ticket put it to green light your house for fiber. This type of ticket is done when a house was missed in the system for saying its available.  Now if you mean a block or two away or a street or two away it is not simple at all. In cases like that it means they almost definitely feed out of a different neighborhood box than you and yours hasnt been upgraded to fiber yet. Expanding fiber to your street would require a full fiber buildout of that neighborhood box meaning replacing the neighborhood box and running new fiber down every street it feeds. While that doesnt mean it wont eventually happen it isnt as simple as just extending it from the existing fiber as each neighborhood box feeds a specific area and isnt designed to expand into areas covered by other boxes.  In the end unless your next door neighbor has it but you dont all you can really do is wait until they upgrade your neighborhood box. There is no rhyme or reason to how they decide to upgrade areas and right now there is a hold on build out in some areas until more of the already ran fiber has more customers sign up/convert over to it.','-','/r/ATT/comments/1btcml7/any_way_to_get_fiber_at_my_address_all/kxl9s1l/'

In May 2023 I went to a barely 1000 people concert in Moore Theatre (Downtown) and absolutely nothing loaded on data the entire concert with T-Mobile 5G UC. I do know a lot of Seattle people use T-Mobile due to the presence of their HQ in Bellevue. To be honest it was the T-Mobile trial which should have full priority. Verizon at least had working but slow LTE. T-Mobile 5G UC was slightly faster than Verizon 5G UW at my hotel near the convention centre though.   Sadly my experience with T-Mobile since 2018 (SoCal) is always unreliable and failing me in the oddest places (if not rural/suburban coverage its places like hospitals with no service)   Verizon 5G UW was good throughout downtown Seattle (Capitol Hill) and SeaTac airport but oddly enough a lot of LTE-only not 5G areas in 2023... Found it odd that Verizon would not deploy 5G in airport areas due to their voluntary C-band ban at the time.   Unfortunately didnt use AT&T while in Seattle. Verizon does rank #1 in Seattle according to Rootmetrics reports.
