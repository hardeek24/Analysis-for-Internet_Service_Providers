I followed the instructions Cox provided for the settings that would have to change but found I could send mail but couldnt receive any. The solution which wasnt mentioned in Cox instructions was to change the authentication protocol for incoming mail from Normal Password to OAuth.  Once you complete the setup successfully you will not be able to access your mail on Cox servers. All your mail including folders will have been moved to Yahoo servers.  Im not a big fan of Yahoo so I have moved all my stuff to GMail but Im keeping the cox.net addresses on Yahoo to catch any correspondents I may have forgotten to update to the GMail addresses. After a year I will probably delete them. Like you I have been with Cox for decades before Yahoo or GMail even existed. Now that my email is no longer tied to Cox I can easily dump Cox for OEC as soon as I get the chance so they have actually done me a big favor. Which answers one of your questions: Once your mail is moved you can use any ISP available to you and your cox.net addresses will still work like they always did.','-','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/1b6geha/cox_email_changes/kvojdjf/'

I tried the 678-608-4070 and it had a Cox auto response and told me I was in queue. However after the hold music stopped there was just silence and then I was hung up on. I tried calling again and said hello a few times as soon as I heard the silent line and was hung up on even faster. Not sure what to make of that.     I used this link instead [https://www.cox.com/residential/special-offers/come-back.html](https://www.cox.com/residential/special-offers/come-back.html) (thank you barefootBam!!!) and clicked the Get Reconnected button. It ended up being sightly less than a 40% discount to keep our current plan since we had the 500 mbps - we were paying a $49.99/month 12-month promotional rate and the new version was $59.99. However the 500 mbps + unlimited data plan was also $59.99 so we went with that because why not add the extra service!     The new services we signed up for were listed as a 24-month promotional plan and when I called Coxs general customer service to clarify they did say its a new 24-month promotion from today not 24 minus the 12 months of the other promotional plan we had.      Id still love to switch to a cheaper option like Verizon but since we rent and Cox is our only option this seemed like a pretty decent solution and Im glad its set for 24 months. I hope the rest of yall have success and thank you so much to everyone who listed out all of these super helpful solutions and comments I appreciate yall!','-','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/b946b8/how_to_get_40_off_the_cox_retail_pricing/kvr6j7w/'

The logic being that it is for my own protection because slowing it down would help avoid charges from exceeding my data allotment. Makes about as much sense as saying COVID infections are lower when there is less testing.   Then I discover I’d been misled when I called previously when my GigaBlast promotion ended. I was promised I could keep the exact same plan and actually reduce my bill with a modest decrease in total bandwidth used. It sounded too good to be true so I double-checked every detail. Then I find out not only had my data cap been reduced but my new plan was actually for 100 Mbps not 1000. He convinced me to upgrade to 250 Mbps promising an immediate big improvement. It jumped to 70-80 Mbps or so. Fast forward a month and it is very inconsistent. I had 20 Mbps this morning 40 a few hours later but the most Ive reached is 120 Mbps which I suppose is about right since 1/2 the published speed is pretty much par for the course these days.

The S33 is more future proof because of the 2.5Gbps ethernet port and being capable of high split(faster upload). If you want to be able to swap the modem at a Cox store(while under warranty) also consider the Technicolor [CVA4004](https://www.cox.com/residential/support/technicolor-cva4004.html). Much of it comes down to your budget.  As for the router again it comes down to budget and wifi requirements. I suggest a Wifi 6 router as most devices arent compatible with 6Ghz that comes with Wifi 6e and Wifi 7. However check your devices to see what they are capable of. I like Asus routers as they have a good user interface IMO and have lots of options. However others will suggest you seperate your router and Wifi AP with something like Unifi. If you are looking for a blind suggestion I like the RT-AX88u Pro as it has dual 2.5Gbps ports for faster then 1Gbps speeds and is Wifi 6. This is a good match if your going with the S33. TP-Link is decent if you are looking to save money.','kwcp26n','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/1bmc3iy/new_modemsrouters_didnt_work_had_to_used_my_old/kwda28q/'

I then reconnected modem to new directly run rg6 and took measurements.   I was able to procure my own band attenuators to get signals levels as close to 0 dbmv on all channels (with +/- 3 dbm).  I always had the measurements handy if I ever needed a tech to come out.  For me understanding the technology with a dose of patience always helped me.  Now I am on fiber with Cox (here in Henderson NV next to Vegas).  I guess we were a lucky neighborhood to get a fiber retrofit as our neighborhood homes were built in 1995-1997.  I have a rental property in Henderson a 3 year old townhouse.  I have Centurylink fiber their.  I pay $70 a month for 1 Gb symmetrical service.  For 1 gb symmetrical service on Cox at my primary home is $109.  I downgraded Cox to 250/250 for $70.  I used to pay the extra $50 a month for unlimited data as I use about 1.5 to 1.8 Tb per month.  I added vzw home internet for $45 connect both connection to my Ubiquity router and load balance between both services ensuring I use lest then 1.25 tb with Cox.  I also now have a redundant connection if either one goes down.','-','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/1bl854s/what_is_the_reason_for_you_to_be_a_cox_customer/kwe1kj7/'

'kws56mo','2024-03-27 04:14:52','lindenb','1bogb0l','Tech Tip for Mac Users','If you have a backup of your computer you can recover them--but make sure that both mail and notes are selected on your Yahoo account first.  If notes was not selected --once you do it should copy over from cox. If not youll need to go to a backup prior to the email transition and find the folder for User (yourname) inside that folder youll see another folder for Library and inside that a folder entitled Mail.  Inside Mail you will find yet another folder entitled V(X) where X is a number for your OS--in my case it was 9 because I am running Monterey--but if you are later than it may be 10 or even 11. Copy--do not move--that folder into some place on your mac- downloads is where I put mine.  Open that folder and youll see a lot more folders--some of which are Alpahnumerics--they should be at the top of the list.  Each of these corresponds to an email account on your mac and one of them is your Cox account.  Once you have figured out which folder it is and which files (in your case notes) in that folder you want to recover go into your Mail app on the Mac and select Import Mailboxes.  Youll need to navigate to the file you located earlier for your notes and select it in the dialog box.  That will recover your notes file.

I contacted them back and they said their decision was final that my speeds would stay reduced for a while and then automatically return to full speed later.      Maybe throttling isnt the right word for what they do maybe theres a different word or term to describe when an ISP deliberately/consciously (rather than in an automated way by code in their system) temporarily slows down your connection due to high data usage maybe something like temporary forced downgrade.      From my end user point of view the slowing down of my connection due to my usage being over specific amount of data seemed like they throttled my connection. But if throttling means that it has to happen automatically and maybe incrementally by code in their systems then yeah I can see how you could call this not throttling','kwuuovx','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/yhssi9/throttling/kwvthly/'

I remember troubleshooting a customer with a similar experience. They had an Ethernet hub connecting directly to the router the issue was the Ethernet hub causing some red flags: ip address looked sketched and their firewall blocked it from certain apps if you have an Ethernet hub try removing it from your network.   What service are you using from cloudflare? VPN web security etc.  This seems like a cloudflare issue and resetting your ip may resolve the solution but it can potentially happen again. If you haven’t contacted them already I’d say it’s a good idea. I found this informative and there’s some other links within it as well https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1106240 . The last thing I recommend is turning off any type of security/protection as it’s usually on there for a reason.    Is the modem/router a cox rental or yours? If it’s a cox rental and disconnecting the modem for about a minute or so and reconnecting it doesn’t resolve your issue then do a modem swap which costs $0. If it’s yours then either look on forums for your specific setup or call the manufacturer.   Keep in mind that Cox complete care may not cover ip changes and it’s also a 90 day contract. Try calling in tech support during normal business hours to get a 2nd opinion have a higher chance of talking to someone who isn’t a high churn outsourced employee.  If they can’t help you ask to be transferred to tier 2. They’re more seasoned and well rounded. But if you have to get the damned thing. I’m sure $30 is worth resolving the issue and you could dispute the chargers after.   Hope this helps good luck','kx76ud0','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/1bqdekc/cant_change_ip_without_paying/kx9iezt/'

Once you have a stand alone modem see what your speeds are directly connected to it. If that is slow look at your signal levels at [192.168.100.1](https://192.168.100.1). If your fastest speed is around 600 look at your downstream OFDM channel(s). You should have two and show be between -5 and +5dB with SNR above 36 with only a few(or none) uncorrectables. Finally if your only problem is Steam keep in mind a lot of factors come into play when downloading something from a server. Things like where that server is their upload bandwidth and congestion between your computer and that server. A new modem/router may not help but probably wont hurt.  As for what router a lot of that depends on what you need and your budget. Do you have Wifi 6/6E/7 devices?

Hopefully a cheaper fiber company comes in and I can switch because $120 for internet with a data cap of which you have to pay $49.99/mo to remove totaling $169.99 ($149.99 since Im on that 2-year lock in) is ridiculous.

','*sigh* That’s not throttling.  If it was throttling using a vpn or not would’nt matter as throttling would need a change to your actual cmts controlled flow rate. Basically Throttling if it did occur would need to result in your modem configuration to be changed limiting your in and out flow rate which at that point a vpn wouldn’t even be able to cause you to get more speeds.  Sounds more like inefficient routing or a problem with a hop somewhere.

During the registration process during on-boot one of the parameters updated in your modems configuration file is the ds and us flow rate aka your max allowed speed with over provisioning.   This is why whenever you call to upgrade or downgrade your speed tiers they either ask you to reboot your modem or initiate an updated themselves.

Definitely check the source of the email sender as being legitimately Cox. I help a company run their website and their FB page for the e-commerce integrations. We get a lot of baseless copyright infringement warnings that appear legit at first but then the bogus url they want you to click saying that they are with FB etc is what is a big flag and then realize it to be a hoax or spam bot etc.   Im just saying this as anyone initially getting messages unsuspecting like this may be scammed into the link clicking. Not saying your notifications arent real or legit Im just saying as perspective of we have been getting a lot lately and their email may be out there to get these batch attempts of Phishing this could be the possibility too.','-','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/1bw8dd2/got_a_second_email_from_cox_for_copyright/ky4j4s9/'

They said if I bundled phone w/internet it would cut both bills… which it absolutely did. Internet bill went down from $112 to $82 great! I also got an extra iPhone for my son at $6/mo plus $80 unlimited for both our plans also great! Okay… so the service… I consistently have only 2 bars. I live in Vegas not near the strip but in the suburbs. The area I live in is well developed though and I never had any signal issues with AT&T. Soon as I enter my local grocery stores signal goes straight to SOS...weird. Most importantly when switching over I was not offered insurance. When I called back in the next couple of days prior to getting my sons new phone they told me it was too late and I could no longer get it if I did not sign up when I initially switched…. I argued with them for a whole day because the rep didn’t offer it or let me know the circumstances.

','That is the general approach Cox is using to offer a lower monthly rate for Internet service.  The mobile service that Cox is providing is decent IMO as it is using Verizon Wireless as their network.   For me I do not need a new mobile service provider as I am perfectly happy with the service and price I receive from Verizon.  In my market (Las Vegas) the 1 Gb plan is $120 but you can get it for $109 by asking (I have this).    You mention you work from home.  Not sure what that entails but I do to.  For me I am on many MS Teams or Google/Zoom/WebEx calls through out the week with Voice always and video \~ 50% of the time.  Also standard access to 0365 apps or other cloud systems e.g. Service Now or Oracle NetSuite.  I also have 85 other devices connected to my network mostly IoT smart devices (Wemo water meter smart irrigation etc) and TVs that have DIrecTV streaming (3) and Roku streaming (Netflix Prime etc.).  So I can tell you I have had service from Cox at the 250 Mb speed for $70 and that is all I need to work from home and support all of the devices on the network.  When I was on 250 the only meaningful thing I saw that was different than having the 1 Gb service was the time to load Roku streaming channels -- perhaps another 8 to 15 seconds additional time to load -- then everything was fine.  I am not a gamer.  I went back to 1 Gb service recently and am paying more as I recently was upgraded to true Fiber service so my speeds at any Tier (100 Mb 250 Mb 500 Mb 1 Gb or even 2 Gb) are now symmetrical meaning that I get the same download \*and\* upload speeds.  And the latency was reduced significantly as well.  If ones Cox Internet service (today) is supplied via traditional Cable then the uploads will be between 10 Mb to 100 Mb.  I wanted the additional upload speed as I do sync many files a good amount very large to/from cloud storage and many of these files are changed repeatedly.    Net-Net -- depending on your work from home needs you can easily get by with the lowest speeds Cox has to offer to power your work from home tools IMO.  It this the other stuff you might use in your home (gaming video etc.) thay may drive you to a higher speed.  Last comment especially since so many folks are now working from home since the pandemic if one has problems with connectivity consider a Mesh network.  The days of one device does it all are fading due to the demand of so many connected devices.  Also if you can use a wire (cat5/6) to connect a device use the ethernet cable!  Good luck!','-','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/1bwuxqj/did_i_just_get_screwed/kycitlg/'

'kyi7ngh','2024-04-07 11:36:30','lindenb','t6227n','Connected but no internet','There are 4 or 5 lights on most modems.  The topmost--on most modems is the power on light--that is followed by a send light a receive light an online light and on some modems there is a light for link.  Those lights change color and/or may blink or be steady depending on their status.  Typically on Arris modems the send and receive lights will be either blue or green depending on whether the signal is bonded or not--when they are establishing a connection they will blink but once connected they should be steady.  The online--what some describe as the globe icon light will blink until a connection with Cox is established then become steady indicating there is a stable connection.  If the modem is connected to a router via an ethernet cable it will also show a light --amber or blue to indicate what type of ethernet connection exists. Lights of any other color --especially blinking and red or yellow indicate a faulty connection.   From your description we can establish that you do not have communication with Cox--and the send/receive lights indicate that they are not bonded which of course follows. If the modem has no connection to router is moot--because it derives its signal from the modem.  There are many possible reasons for the issue but only a few things you can do to try to troubleshoot.   The most basic is to power down the modem and router.  unplug the power adaptors.   Then unscrew and remove the coaxial cable from the modem.  Wait at least 2 minutes. Reattach the coaxial cable.  Reattach the modem power adaptor and turn on the modem.  it should reboot and go through its power-up sequence until all four lights are solid and lit. If that is the case reconnect the power adaptor to your modem and power it on--wait till you see its lights lit without blinking.  At this point you should have an internet connection and a wifi signal.   If that is not the case--youll need to call Cox tech support.   They can run a diagnostic remotely and if they tell you there is no issue with the signal you may have a dead or dying modem.    If the modem comes back but not the router-or if once you power up the router you do not see your router then you may have a dead or dying router.   As for replacements should you need them:  Cox has a support page which  provides a list of nmodems they support.  They can range in price fro  less than $100. to many hundreds.  Price is not necessarily an indication of quality.  These days unless you live in a house that is small in size and on one level I suggest buying a standalone modem--Nighthawk and Arris are both decent--and be sure to buy a modem that is DOCIS 3.1  as Cox is phasing out support for DOCIS 3.0.   I do not like te all in one router/modem devices as any failure of a common element such as a power supply means tghat both pieces are effectively dead and IMO--they do not perform as well as separate modems and routers.  The other reason is that if you have wi fi reception issues because of a larger home multiple floors or hard to reach areas you may want to buy a mesh system.  That is a router with multiple nodes--each of which connect to the others wirelessly and provide much better signal quality and range than a single router.  Typically they can be a single double triple or more nodes and can cost from a few hundred to many hundreds of dollars depending on the number of nodes etc.  I like TP link or Nighthawk for standalone routers--as a good quality for a decent price--youll want an A 1800/wifi 6 model which can be found for less than $100. As for mesh systems Google/Nest or Eero are easy to set up and work well--TP link also sells a mesh system for use with its modem though I have not used it.    If you shop around you should be able to buy a standalone modem and standalone router combo for under $250-if you go with a mesh system you should still be able to keep it under $300 depending on the number of nodes you need.  Figure one node per floor for a multilevel house and add more if there are areas that you have been unable to reach with your existing router--but that is a general rule and you may want to buy only as much as you know you need and see whether another node or more is needed.','kyhbbri','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/t6227n/connected_but_no_internet/kyi7ngh/'

Is that what you mean by added to my account?  If not that is the issue.  if it was provisioned then quite likely the signal levels are too low.  Here is a link to an article that will tell you how to check signal level--it is for the S33 Arris modem but the same instructions apply for other Arris modems. If you have a long ethernet cable or a laptop this is a good deal easier because you need to connect a computer to the modem directly then access the modem admin screen to check signal levels.  Even before you do that--the computer should have internet access once connected.  If it doesnt--it requires Cox tech support.  If you have connection to the Internet via the ethernet cable from the computer to the modem then your router would appear to be the issue--and that is outside cox responsibility.  You can try to connect the computer via ethernet to the router and follow the instructions to interrogate the router:Plug in the power adapter of your modem router to the power outlet.  1. Turn on the modem router and wait for the power LED to become solid green or white. 2. Type its login credential. Default username is admin and default password is password. 3.

I argued with them for a whole day because the rep didn’t offer it or let me know the circumstances.

That said - you may be prioritized below core Verizon customers or your neighborhood might just be better on ATT/TMO.   As to pricing bundles - theyre all over the place - if you can save decent money then just take the SIM and dont use it - if youre in a market where its a $50 discount its worth it. If not see what other competition is out there. When I had Xfinity in Seattle I took the phone bundle for two years to reduce the bill by a chunk. The only major problem I have with COX is the BS 1.25 TB data cap when anything that streams including streaming subscriptions off the cable box counts against your cap. Ive got two users in the house on VPN to the office M-F and another in college classes so some VPN to school and a ton of streaming to Netflix and Youtube ... :) . I cruised through that cap this month without issue because I needed to pull down new distros of Linux for my work systems. I dont care about paying extra - I do care about some song and dance sales pitch I have to spend five minutes in when I just want max data and to never talk to you again.   When I had Century link this was a non issue (synchronous speed - no data cap) I only deal with this crap in Phoenix and the customer care reps when you get them on the phone seem a bit ... not the sharpest tack. Fortunately theres a new fiber company in my part of the valley and theyll be out Thursday to replace Cox and their service is synchronous - not this asynchronous crap that Cox tosses around which is less favorable when working on VPN with more than one VPN connection up. If that works out Im at least off Cox for two years.','ky9oifk','/r/CoxCommunications/comments/1bwuxqj/did_i_just_get_screwed/kynnoth/'
