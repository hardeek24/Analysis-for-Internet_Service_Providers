It seems to be completely random how they will manage things like this. In some other cases they will just send you a new SIM card to swap into your current gateway. But them completely doing a new line for things is pretty common.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bv8pgy/home_internet_plan_upgrade/ky3may5/'

'ky3n734','2024-04-04 17:38:27','atom0s','1bve8nd','Speed Issues','The speed differences you are seeing is normal. Phone plans on T-Mobiles network are at the higher/highest priorities on their towers while the home internet service is at the lower two tiers of priority. Home internet is using left-over bandwidth on the tower but is deprioritized behind other traffic.   As for the speed issues between reboots that is also common with T-Mobiles stock gateways. A common cause of this is due to overheating as well as just generally poor firmware. Suggestions for that would be to add a fan to your gateway (you can search for examples of doing this non-destuctively and/or with 3D printed mounting etc.) and to setup a means to automatically reboot the gateway at some kind of interval. (Some do nightly others do weekly and so on.) For that you can use a smart outlet to just kill its power at a set time or if you understand how to work with API endpoints it is possible to setup a script to reboot the gateway more properly but will require something on your network to be online to do the reboot request such as a Raspberry Pi or something similar if you dont keep a computer on 24/7.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bve8nd/speed_issues/ky3n734/'

As far as watching YouTube thats not a big loss as there really isnt much worth watching there anyway. Go ahead and bite the bullet and get cable internet for $200. You wont regret it!   PS: Id check your iPhone not on WiFi to help diagnose your problem. If its still crappy using 5G on your phone then you have a tower problem. If its only crappy on WiFi then you likely have an extremely crowded tower. Also see what speeds you get at 3:00 in the morning.

Im in the second group.  From 2010 to 2023 I had 3mbit DSL.  Was all I could get.  So I was thrilled to get TMHI last year.  Im getting 200mbit down and 60mbit up.  Im in a rural area so my tower is never congested. Not enough people.    But TMHI still isnt perfect.  Id never use it over cable/fiber.  Its not steady your speeds can vary greatly.  The ping sucks.  And the CGNAT is horrible at times.    Im thankful for TMHI but Ill be switching over to fiber as soon as they finish splicing the terminals by my house in.

In fact it would be financially stupid for them to do so as theyd not only lose the business there would be the extra cost of refurbishing a used gateway.   It could be many things...  \- Tower Maintenance  \- System congestion and/or prioritization kicking in  \- Connected to a different antenna or even a different tower altogether  If you havent already try restarting the gateway. If that doesnt change anything put the gateway on a long extension cord so you dont have to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in and then try different spots around your home. Even a rotation in place can make a difference. Remember higher signal strength doesnt always equate to higher speed. I have a spot in my house where I can get better metrics in every category yet the speed is barely enough to stream in 720p yet in the normal spot which only gets two bars my speed is 180/60 on average.   Lastly try foil behind the gateway as a collector/reflector kind of the like the dish on a satellite setup. Like in [this graphic](https://imgur.com/6rsc3y7) looking from above where the foil is grey the gateway red and the arrow pointing toward the tower. I actually hang a foil curtain three layers thick and about a 12W x 8H from the back of the fan I have on top of my gateway. Without it I cant connect to 5G. I folded the top so it has a half inch lip on it to hang on the edge of the fan and cut a slit in the bottom for the wires sticking out of the back of the gateway (power cord and USB fan cord).

I’ve also noticed that the translated ip always takes the same path to the closest ipv4 exit point (real public ip).   But in NSA mode my private core ip could potentially take many different paths (on each reboot I find my ‘closest’ speedtest server changes - along with my overall performance (latency and or bandwidth).

These people are going to lose their minds. Then G7 G8 G9 the horror just thinking about it. The G literally stands for generation.    5G is a little higher at 3.4GHz to 3.6GHz but thats tiny when you consider that microwaves go up to 300GHz. And visible light comes in at a range of around 430THz to 770THz. Thats more than a thousand times higher than the maximum microwave – and 100000 higher than 5G.  On a bright note 6G is expected to be another huge leap even greater than 5G. The latency will be 1000 times faster than 5G and 6G will operate at 95 GHz to 3 terahertz (THz). At those wavelengths 6G will also have speeds that are 1000 times faster than 5G.   The biggest problem Ive had with 5G internet is the latency its awful.

The other two parts are spectrum capacity and backhaul capacity.    For spectrum capacity congestion on a specific sector or band of thay sector such as N41 will cause poor download speeds.  To many users on that sector of that tower.  Backhaul capacity refers to the fiber line thats connecting the tower to WAN.  Depending on location this will typically be 1gb or 10gb.  If you have awesome signal but slower data service on the internet gateway while having normal data service on your phone its 100% a capacity issue.

'kydzqfi','2024-04-06 15:42:49','HowToKillAGod','1bxmb4p','Curiosity about streaming to twitch on TMHI','1. Routers is a problem. As a general rule of thumb you should only ever have one router per internet connection. You can use some routers as simple Switches and/or Access Points for WiFi by not using the WAN port and disabling DHCP. Note that the TMHI gateways are already routers themselves. Plug-and-playing multiple routers together will create a situation called Double (or more) NAT which outside of some homelab situations is never something you want.  1a. Though the whole point of 802.11 is to standardize WiFi manufacturers still kind of do whatever they want. They may add additional technology/features that are only compatible with their own devices. Some may advertise interoperability with other brands also using non-standard features but its little more than crossed fingers.  As a general rule if within your control stick to one brand of WiFi equipment if not the same product line from the brand.   2. WiFi Mesh has come a long way since the first implementations 20+ years ago but the very nature of it means it will always be less than ideal and perform worse than not just a wired Ethernet connection but also worse than a direct WiFi connection (sans interference) to the primary Access Point (or Router for these consumer offerings from Asus Linksys etc.)    2a. Understand that Mesh WiFi networks operate by receiving data using multiple antennas assemble that data and then forward it along to the next node that does the same operation all over again.  Each stop introduces latency and is exposed to its own unique combination of RF interference from its environment to work around.    2b. When you browse the web you likely experience no appreciable difference because web data is transmitted intermittently. The breaks between a web browser sending and receiving requests for multiple pieces of data are more than enough time to make up for any latency on your LAN.    2c. Constant uninterrupted data rates are required for live streaming. When you stream something from Netflix or another service you usually have a fat buffer of data that smooths out inconsistencies giving you an uninterrupted experience.  Live streams with live audiences/chat need as little delay as possible meaning virtually no buffer and much less tolerance.  To use an analogy think of trying to fill a pool with water.  A water hose is an ethernet cord. Mesh on the other hand is a line of people passing buckets of water to each other. Eventually the pool will be filled but not without losses.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bxmb4p/curiosity_about_streaming_to_twitch_on_tmhi/kydzqfi/'
