I personally can lose up to two drives and still not lose a single bit of data.  Additionally if I did have a drive die only the data in that specific drive is at risk not the other drives in the NAS.  A media file on a HDD is physical media. Its the same file just in a different disk.','kx78s0m','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bphb4v/the_film_fans_who_refuse_to_surrender_to/kx8wrgs/'

Plus continue watching is still very broken.  I know they did a lot under the surface to the Disney+ app and the content but they really need to fix the way you manage content in the app.  Hulu at least lets you filter movies and TV shows and also shows what is expiring.  None of that is possible in Disney.  Not switching till they fix all that and allow the merging of watch histories.','kx4t0ao','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bqsk25/the_disney_plushulu_merger_is_way_more_than_a/kx8xpgg/'

'kx8yvpg','2024-03-30 06:12:51','westom','1br98ws','Does an antenna on a screened porch need to be grounded or can it be treated like an indoor antenna?','Disinformation is rampant.  First what is the concern?  A lightning strike?  Why would lightning avoid something conductive (wood called a porch roof) to strike a portable antenna?  It will not.  But lightning might strike AC wires many block away to directly strike that TV.  That is a concern.  And nothing that plugs in will avert such damage.  Only the most easily dupe consumers foolishly think a thousand joules inside a magic strip will somehow absorb a surge: *hundreds of thousands of joules*.  Or that its 2 cm protector part will block what three miles of sky cannot.  Protection only exists when one properly earths a whole house protector at the service entrance.  Protector only does something useful when connected low impedance (ie less than 10 feet) to single point *earth* ground.  (Obviously *earth* ground is not wall receptacle *safety* ground.)  Only those electrodes (never a protector) protects that TV.  And every other appliance in that house.  Reception: portable TV antennas are mostly hooey.  Stringing some wires in the porch ceiling would be just as effective.  They market a magic antenna subjectively.  Educated consumers always learn numbers and reasons why.  Serious antennas are designed for all three TV bands.  First learn which frequencies are relevant.  VHF-low.  VHF-hi.  Or UHF.  Channel numbers are intentionally deceptive.  A station on channel two (VHF-low) can actually be broadcasting on channel 23 (UHF).  Never ask for a solution until the problem(s) is first defined.  Hardware protection is first discussion.  Since all destructive transients (ie direct lightning strikes) must be earthed (not just bleed off as wild speculation claims).  Define the threat long before considering a solution.  Reception means first defining what is required.  Such as [here](http://www.receptionmaps.com/).  Problems are always first defined long before even asking for a solution.','-','/r/cordcutters/comments/1br98ws/does_an_antenna_on_a_screened_porch_need_to_be/kx8yvpg/'

Start with doing a search on Disney+ for Jeopardy: youll find Celebrity Jeopardy all right but not any results for Jeopardy Masters. I cant find other items that are on my Hulu My Stuff list either.    Nor can you import your Hulu My Stuff lists to the Disney+ Watchlist either.

Broadcast is becoming more irrelevant especially to anyone under 30 and as time goes on that will be anyone under 40 50 etc. They better wake up before its too late  The 1996 telecommunications law needs to be changed. At bare minimum retrans fees need to be lowered( preferably banned but Im being generous here ) and pay TV cant charge more for a broadcast fee than what they pay for in re-trans fees. Also locals must be an OPTION one a can opt out of. Also franchise fees need to be banned.

It’s nice to whip out an iPad and watch live TV if there’s not good cell service wherever we are. And plenty of DVR’ed stuff if there’s no antenna service either.   With a little hackery using Tailscale and a couple of raspberry Pi’s I can use the Tablo app at home. Our RV is stored in a storage lot but we have it outfitted with a full solar/lithium battery setup so it can stay on permanently. And we actually can watch live TV at home streamed from our RV (which has a TV antenna we don’t have one at home.) Kind of a convoluted use case but… it works!','-','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bripjo/is_tablo_tv_any_good/kxaid9d/'

In my city Comcast has to pay 5 percent of gross revenues quarterly as the franchise fee as detailed in the 10 year franchise agreement that can be renewed or not renewed by the city every 10 years. No wonder cities wont drop exclusivity agreements like this and we have monopolies.  I attended the hearing by the city on the franchise renewal last year. I was allowed to speak and ask questions of the Comcast representatives at the hearing. I brought up the massive increases over the past 5 years of local station retransmission fees and asked why customers cannot opt out of receiving local channels to lower the cost of cable TV service. The lead Comcast rep told me and the franchise board that the retransmission fees would be even higher if they allowed customers to opt out as the local TV station owners base the fee on the number of customers served. The less customers the higher the price. They agreed that the current 28.95 a month charge is ridiculous. They said their hands are tied by federal law and it is killing their TV subscriber numbers. I buy that argument up to a point.  I am beginning to see a shift of customers from blaming the cable and satellite companies for station blackouts during contract disputes and moving toward the greedy local TV station owners. Congress does nothing constructive as we all know. It would be great if they would do away with the current must carry law and put a fair percentage cap on retransmission costs to cable TV and satellite providers.

Streaming video content is accelerating it. And if it wasnt for the NFL and college football they would be gone much sooner.   I dropped cable two years ago because in no way am I paying 20.00/month to local broadcasters to have access to my local stations  I am lucky that I can receive my local stations with an inexpensive flat antenna.      The local TV station owners are putting all of their eggs in the ATSC 3.0 basket as they feel they can shore up dwindling ad revenue by offering pay as you go  services in addition to their free OTA content. Too little too late in my opinion.      My best friend works at a local TV station and they are trying to hold on for three more years before they get their 25 years in and retire but they are realistic and they could be on the chopping block before then and if they sniff out any idea that their job is going to be phased out or going to be replaced by someone younger (and cheaper) theyll head to HR and retire sooner.','kxd1eif','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bqri4s/nab_disputes_fcc_contention_that_retrans/kxdyr0j/'

They are so despicable as to even sue and attack organizations such as the NFPA and IEEE.  Because all accurately demeans those bleed off charges myths.  ESE myths were even proven by one glaring example.  ESE industry never did even one scientific study.  Instead they put their money into advertising myths and lawsuites.  Lightning is a connection from charges in a cloud (ie 3 miles up) to earthborne charges (ie maybe four miles distant).  Protection only exists when that connection (the electric current path) is nowhere inside a building.  All effective protectors do just that.  Connect that current (ie 20000 amps) from a sky to earth on a path that is nowhere inside a structure.  As Franklin demonstrated over 250 years ago.  In one experiment the FAA put an ESE device on a control tower.  Three days later lightning struck it and blew it off the building.  Where was the bleeding?  Obviously a direct lightning strike proved no such bleeding exists.  But then many only hear one thing.  Never ask why.  Ignore well proven science.  Then order us what to believe.  Numbers only exist when honesty exists.  How do 20000 amps connect from a cloud to earthborne charges?  Effective protection gives that electric current a superior path that remains outside and is not destructively through anything (ie a church steeple).  Nothing does lightning protection by bleed off charges in the air.  This reality will make many mad rather than contribute in a logical manner.','kx81bui','/r/cordcutters/comments/1br98ws/does_an_antenna_on_a_screened_porch_need_to_be/kxe8vo7/'

Best protection is a hardwire from that coax to the only item that does all protection: single point *earth* ground.  Any protector without that low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) connection to electrodes does nothing.  Unfortunately many only see a magic device as doing anything useful.  Franklin 250 years ago demonstrated what does coax protection: earth ground.  [Every professional organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/9bgibi/how_do_you_guys_have_your_antenna_grounded/e57mjar/) also says that.  One must first learn that well proven science.  Routinely implemented even over 100 years ago.  Then ignore advertising hearsay wild speculation and other disinformation that intentionally confuses a protect**or** with protect**ion**.  Those are two different things.  A most common incoming surge path is AC mains.  A surge is incoming to everything.  But only damaged is the item(s) that makes a best connection to earth.  Incoming on AC mains.  A best outgoing path is via a TV connected to an earthed coax connector.  Earthed because best protection is required on and is installed by the coax cable company.  Required by numerous standards and the National Electrical code.    One should know these so many and well proven concepts standards and industry practices before making recommendations.','kx7rzfc','/r/cordcutters/comments/1br98ws/does_an_antenna_on_a_screened_porch_need_to_be/kxeb66j/'

I have tried to switch to newer things like Plex Channels and Emby but keep using the sagetv for the recordings as its the only one that ALWAYS records the shows.  The others did not work out due to occasionally not recording things.  And thats really bad when its for the wife and whats being recorded isnt available via streaming for a week or more after.   I would never look at anything else except the client side of SageTV is now abysmal.  Nothing they have plays h.265.  So recently I tried Channels and Emby as a front end.  Channels was a bit to unstable they update it way to often for me to keep testing it.  Then I tried Emby and it was fairly good but it couldnt deal with unstructured video files (just in a folder Channels and Emby required a specific folder structure per video/show.  Although the Emby dev said that will be fixed in the future.    Currently using Plex for the Clients as the Plex back-end can deal with the non structured file system and just reads the sagetv files.   SageTV does have a automated  compression built in but it wont do H.265 at the moment.  I am sure it can just dont have enough time to get it working so I run a batch script off the Task Scheduler to make the files into H.265 (HEVC) and Plex has no issues playing them.    I want them as small as possible as we travel a lot frequently are in places without internet service.  (Alaska last summer)  So those smaller files can be drop-boxed to the DVR in the motor-home and can be watched no matter if we can get internet or not.

Apple is a commitment.   The shows are gorgeous but theyre slow and take a few episodes for me to catch on.  To be fair I dont think its worth paying for.  But I like it as a perk.  Personally I think they should offer a plan with ads.  It would af least break up the monotony of their programming.   At least as an option and those that want ad free can keep paying $9.99 or whatever theyre charging now.   Apple is also a highly niche service that is very particular and eccentric with what they do offer.  For example their MLS and MLB programming is just enough for viewers to pony up more money to take a deep dive but also good enough for casual viewers that will never buy the ad ons.  They also offer old Hollywood movies for short periods of time.  I see this as a service that doesnt want to do what the competition does but will find their own way to do what everyone else is to stay relevant.

KPIX is great at times and stuttery/pixelated when it’s windy or rainy. Very inconsistent whereas NBC FOX ABC are great all the time.   I’ll try the amplifier. Do you have any amplifier recs I can try out? Thanks','kxgv0dk','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bshmvp/kpix_in_south_bay/kxh3w1d/'

Some can switch between cable and OTA. And I believe it was my beloved Premiere that could do both at the same time (handy when broadcast had gone HD but cable was still analog).','kxglr0t','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bskdpr/consultant_need_so_much_help/kxhvzvv/'

'kxixc3n','2024-04-01 03:40:59','ClosetCentrist','1bscytv','Verizon Home Internet','I went way up the support chain with Verizon about the IP address thing and theres nothing you can do about it. What was getting me was that it was renewing every single day. It kept renewing during a morning meeting I had at 8:30. It finally occurred to me to just reset it at 5:00 a.m. one morning now its fine. It resets every day but it doesnt bother me.  A bigger problem I had was that there was a firmware update with the modem that screwed up how things loaded in IP pass through mode. I had to make my router double natted on the DMZ. Kind of a pain in the ass for remoting back into my home when Im out and about.','-','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bscytv/verizon_home_internet/kxixc3n/'

Everything else feeds off of that.   I ran coax to every room in the home but Coax has diminishing returns.  More connections = worse signal.  I went from 30-ish local channels to 50+ just by eliminating the other connections.  Im close enough to a metro that we get all kinds of channels we only watch about 4 but its still nice to have options.  As an added bonus our entire digital library is also available via PLEX even home movies.','-','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bsirgj/which_device_do_i_need_to_watch_my_ota_channels/kxj3yi5/'

Best I can guess is 2 (KTVU) & 4 (broadcasts on UHF 31 & 26)... but out of Oakland & San Jose not SF.  But post a report as its impossible to really look at whats going on for where you are at without it.  You could have obstructions or the towers in question are a completely different direction.  Also 7 is on VHF 12 (SF) but also uhf 35 (San Jose).  So you could be getting it on UHF and not vhf like you think you are.','-','/r/cordcutters/comments/1bsgoo4/a_vexing_question_of_reception/kxjozi0/'
