It‚Äôs just so saturated and pay to play now. I‚Äôve gotten some matches on free accounts but I apparently didn‚Äôt come up for a while and on those apps too you also need to pay to get more likes. So that also makes it harder to be seen if matches aren‚Äôt paying for the unlimited likes they might run out before they even see you.  I feel like I‚Äôve only had luck after periods of inactivity and I swear the app does that to pull you back in. Account is inactive -> free higher placement to send a few ‚Äúsomeone likes you‚Äù notifications and encourage you to pay to see who -> right back at the bottom once the app is opened again so you can get flooded with more ads to upgrade.','kvgh7ui','/r/phoenix/comments/1bhtlw9/how_did_you_and_your_partner_meet_in_phoenix/kvj4gbh/'

Your aversion to transit is a function of the Valley’s disinvestment in it. I for one feel safer on public transportation than I do in an Uber because I’m used to a system that’s cleaner than Valley Metro. But that doesn’t mean your fears are invalid: Phoenix just has a bad system.  But we’re talking about biking or walking to a grocery store close enough for it to be reasonable. Keep in mind this isn’t a hike up a mountain. You’re being asked to walk up to half a mile bike a full mile or ebike a mile and a half. Your kids may or may not be along for the ride but let’s assume they are.  It takes approximately 15 minutes to walk a half mile 20 if the kids keep stopping. It takes a similar amount of time to bike the relevant distances. Are you capable of holding a big enough water bottle to last yourself 20 minutes? I should hope so. But maybe your kids can’t (which is fair). The best part about summer days is that they’re long enough for you to just go when it’s more like 105 outside. You really don’t have to go during the heat of the day. If you can’t leave the kids at home then you can just go during the evening when the sun isn’t actively trying to murder you.','kw1e9ya','/r/phoenix/comments/1624pht/lightrail_taking_a_turn/kw22xt9/'

I tried A Sushi recently and the nigiri was straight up warm and the fish was so thin and low quality it was tearing apart like paper.   Judging based off fish flavor/texture/thickness rice ratio temperature etc. And also service is better.

It was our only choice at the time and now several years later I have regrets.  Its really hard to fix after the fact if you feel like your kid needs more time social/emotionally not to mention they are now too young for some summer camps etc that filter by age instead of grade.     Id suggest finding a school that can keep him in the correct grade for his age but provide more academic challenge instead.  IMO thats the best option.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bj44iz/early_kindergarten_entrance_testing/kw29oz2/'

Just like your taxes that pay for roads and highways.  You don’t just use the inches of road you fund.   You don’t “own” a slice of that road. Public education is a public good.   There is no “this is my portion.”  Like roads fire departments etc it is part of the social contract.  We all pay in we all can benefit.   You want your kids to have a private school education?

'kw4vpz8','2024-03-22 18:09:29','FLICK_YOLI','1ble08l','Who’s using AC already?','Just tested her out and shes blowing cold woo hoo!  Just a heads up because I know someone who makes this mistake every year and ends up ripped off by a contractor...  Theyll tell you to save money to run your AC around 78. This can be a mistake with older units.  AC units work best when theyre circulating cold air. Getting cold when its super hot outside can be too much work for your AC if you run it too warm. Trying to maintain 78 can potentially create issues that wont allow it to keep it 78 or cooler.  ACs just run better the colder theyre running. If youre trying to get a house thats 80+ degrees to cool down when its 115 outside theres a good chance its going to fail.   There are a lot of conmen out there who will try to convince you to replace the unit when really itll work fine as long as you keep the house circulating cool air.  I would recommend having a portable AC unit or two to help keep things colder and spare the main unit from having to do all the work and as a backup to help you out in case you get into a situation where the air youre circulating is too warm to get back down again.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1ble08l/whos_using_ac_already/kw4vpz8/'

Your neighbors knew who you were and the clerk at the grocery store knew your name. Now you can live somewhere for years without ever knowing your neighbors name.

I was approved n he proceeded to tell me I had to pay $15 for the crap phone or $70 for the better phone I told him no I dont want his service and left. Next day by Noon my phone was disconnected. I went and confronted them and at first they played dumb like they didnt do it. Finally they apologize and say theirs nothing they can do til the 1st of April and at the time it was only March 8th. So I have no phone and cant get another cuz they transferred my line to a random ghost phone and when applying at any other company Im denied because it shows I have a phone open somewhere active.

In the area theyre going to be Arizona State students. The program runs for free (e.g. no fees to book care online you get matched with studetns and pay them directly only $15 per hour) - so its way more affordable than traditional home care agencies which are charging more than $40 per hour these days. Plus in my opinion the care is just way better because these students are motivated to do a good job as a pathway to future clinical careers.

At least of the US if not more.  It seems to have started up 10-15 years ago. Now you have people on their phones a lot and even not answering unless they know the number.  People not answering doors. People feeling more anxiety. People taking online classes instead of in person. Then covid hit. You (and I) just happened to move right when people started pulling more in to themselves. And then people everywhere just keep getting busier and busier.   I don’t think that means youre stuck though. Do a search for meet up. Or hiking groups. Or charities. Or craft night. Or urban sketchers. Or music lovers. You probably wont find close friends right away but the more you try the more you will find.    You have kids - invite their friends and parents over for a bbq.    Do you follow any local music or architecture or foodie places on instagram? Make a comment that you would love for a fellow fan to join you for coffee at that restaurant - see if anyone replies.','kw52wpn','/r/phoenix/comments/1blfh2r/people_seem_really_unfriendly_here/kw5c2xb/'

'kw5chnb','2024-03-22 20:10:54','Not_me_no_way','1blfh2r','People seem really unfriendly here','Ill be straight up with you. There are way too many transplants who come here and within the first few sentences tell you that theyre from somewhere else and how great it was compared to here. The thing about Phoenix is that it was affordable as long as you dont mind the heat.   Things were more simple a sense of community existed in almost every neighborhood. Sure there were folks that moved here from somewhere else but they didnt make it their identity. They became an Arizonan. They didnt complain about the heat and say things like I dont know how YOU PEOPLE can stand it. As if the heat is different than it was the year before and the year before that. They didnt immediately reflect on where they came from and how much better it was there.   Immediately advertising where you came from and how much different it was will absolutely be an immediate cold shoulder from anyone whos been here long enough or especially an native born here. The reason is that people coming here complaining about how much better it was somewhere else brought the horrific traffic and conflicting driving habits. The days you could rent a 2 bedroom apartment for $600 or buy a 2000 sf house for under $300000 are long gone.   So the moral of the story is that if you cant meet people without telling them how horrible the place they call home is and how much better it is where youre from. Then you should expect to be treated a certain way or maybe you should take yourself back to that place you think is so much better. Because people  here might feel some kind of way about the people who came to their home state and changed it into what you see today.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1blfh2r/people_seem_really_unfriendly_here/kw5chnb/'

I’ve found that most of my friends I’ve met through working which isn’t really helpful I know. But if you make friends with one musician actor or artist it will open the doors to meeting more.    It was similar for me in Chicago too. It took me about 3 years of living in Chicago before I felt like I had a solid friend group. I’ve been in Phoenix since 2019 and have a nice small group of friends (about 5 people) and we get together about every other week. I try to network on Instagram and show up to events people post about. But honestly I do a lot of things alone or with my family.','kw4zdh3','/r/phoenix/comments/1blfh2r/people_seem_really_unfriendly_here/kw5k6hs/'

Not shifting of light frequencies.   Please feel free to investigate that fact for yourself. Its pretty basic science.    Have you ever looked into Phoenix metro air quality?  While it can be considered good overall its not generally ever good with respect to ozone and small particulate matter.   Weve been roughly 1.3 times over the limit on 2.5 in the past week or so.   Now regarding the blood moon those happen on total lunar eclipses.    The next one does not occur until March 14 2025. The last time a real blood moon occurred was in Nov 8 2022.   There is however a partial moon eclipse coming on the 25th but that will just be a dimming no color change save pollution.','kw4jn1h','/r/phoenix/comments/1bl4dp1/blood_moon_this_morning/kw5roo2/'

Be sure to bring a government-issued photo ID to your test.  Follow the instructions on the PSI website (being sure to enter the correct information from the FAA website).  These locations are testing locations for a bunch of different industries.  Youll show up at your scheduled date/time theyll ask you to empty your pockets and then give you all the needed material to take your test. Youll take the test on a computer.  When youre done they hand you a piece of paper that tells you if youve passed or failed.  If you passed move on to Step 4.  If you failed you gotta reschedule for another date/time to take the test.  To answer your question though.  I took my initial test at Falcon Field in Mesa in 2019.  I took my recurrent test at a PSI facility in Tempe in 2021.  2-year recurrent tests are free and taken online now though.','kw5slsj','/r/phoenix/comments/uw46j7/drone_users/kw5u0oq/'

Have another beer and wait it out or walk closer to the longer trip for a bus  (So if youre in downtown and need to get to Mesa?

What I gathered is: your neighbor has dead trees some of dead limbs overhang onto your property. The neighbor is hiring an unlicensed removal “crew” to remove dead trees/limbs and you wonder if you should be concerned about damage/liability since they are unlicensed?   My answer depends on a lot of factors. How far do the limbs overhang? How large is the tree? Does felling or removing the dead limbs pose risks to any of the structures on your property? Generally the neighbors homeowners insurance should cover damages if their trees or removing their trees damages your property.   Depending on those answers I’d probably let the neighbor pay whoever they want to remove their trees. I had a couple of large trees removed from my property and the size/placement for one was fine to have a landscape crew remove it but the other required a crane/boom truck so it required a more $$$ tree removal company. My neighbor’s landlord refused to remove their dying tree that was endangering my wall and part of my home so I also had that company cut the overhang from my side and they have a dying ugly tree that is only endangering their house now. It was $500 to have the crew remove the easy tree and 2k for the removal and trimming neighbors tree at my fence line that required the crane.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1blo0ui/about_tree_trimming_done_by_a_neighbor/kw6yg35/'

These are called Special Damages and if you resolve them prior to becoming represented they wont factor into your lawyerscut of the settlement.  Typically pain and suffering or General Damages payment ranges are quite higher for represented claimants than non (even after factoring in lawyer fees)—a fact which is not necessarily true for Special Damages. As such this component is where your lawyer is of optimal value.   Nuance in traffic law vary from state to state but just wanted to share. Washington State requires PIP (personal injury protection) on policies which is a no fault insurance. Doesnt look like Arizona has that so your med bills might have to be part of a represented settlement. Regardless though trust me on the auto damage portion. You dont want your lawyer eating a chunk of that in the end.   Accidents are scary and insurance companies prey on that fear to resolve claims as equitable as possible. Just trying to arm you with as much info as I can.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1blu2su/yikes/kw7lr13/'

I literally paid people for their Pain and suffering with Farmers money. I was not in the represented arm of the company but had friends there who could pay up to policy maxes for represented settlements. Didnt happen often but there were some cringe cases floating around.  Anyway pain and suffering is absolutely a component of any General Damages settlement. The only thing I can think of in your case would be that your lawyers cut of the medical bills and auto damages accounted for what you would have received for your pain and suffering. That is why I gave the advice I did. If you can figure out your medical bills prior to being represented they can not claim those bills as a portion of your settlement.  For example my wife resolved her med bills and auto damages without lawyer intervention utilizing our insurance to pay the medical bills and having them seek reimbursement from the at fault party on our behalf. This allowed us to seek out a lawyer to resolve the only open claim remaining: her portion of the general damages—explicitly for inconvenience and time away from work. Unrepresented she was offered $500. Lawyered she took home $2800 in her pocket.','kw7p5ls','/r/phoenix/comments/1blu2su/yikes/kw7r097/'

Usually the most ridiculously optimistic comments are upvoted the most in these threads so they give a warped perception of how it is out there. The person you are replying to is probably not lying about their personal experience but many exaggerate things or conflate their success with the norm. Ive read the most ridiculous comments regarding certain jobs pay expectations and the how easy it is to get them on this sub.   My favorite was a person on a recent job related post from like 1-2 months ago boasting about all the remote tech jobs in Phoenix right now. Yeah umm last time I checked thousands of tech workers were laid off and most companies are transitioning back to work in office or hybrid positions. Its bad out there right now. The response I got was that new grads are just whining about difficulty in getting a job to which Id like to ask wouldnt the OP have been in the same situation if he/she/they went into the industry right now? So then how does your logic hold up? To make a bold faced claim like that is ridiculous and people buying into it makes me question if most of the people here know anything about certain job industries. Or if theyre equating their success as normal or are just straight up charlatans.  My other favorite one. A person telling someone with a physics degree who was a teacher for nearly a decade that they can transition into an engineering role because lots of companies in Phoenix are hiring like crazy. Yeah thats not happening folks. Do people who give advice like that even have a job?','kw0uihf','/r/phoenix/comments/1bkbtpd/jobs_in_phoenix_during_summer/kw847in/'

Some popping is normal as youll never fully remove all the sediment out. You shouldnt need to flush anymore that once a year. You should be able to observe if any sediment is being removed at the other end of the hose.      Flushing is bad when people who dont regularly flush it start flushing it. It is also bad when people try to remove the sediment by snaking it out.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bm33im/hard_water_sediment_in_heater_how_often_to_flush/kw9ov6t/'

It took us an hour to get there when we got close. When we got to the gate the MP told us we had to turn around and go to a different gate. He said we needed to go up to camelback and around to northern. Essentially circling pretty much the entire base. I asked if we could just keep going to Litchfield and he said I would be stuck in traffic forever.   We follow his directions and go all the way around the base. When we get to northern to turn towards the base cops tell us we cant go that way and we had to go to Peoria and then get back onto Litchfield.

Volantis is usually packed and has good food and a great view overlooking the tarmac at Scottsdale airport.  Collins Chophouse has a great business lunch but isnt usually packed for lunch (it is for dinner) due to location.  Gertrudes is in the Desert Botanical Gardens and is slways packed for lunch but isnt exactly high-end.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bly7pl/high_end_busy_weekday_business_lunch_spot_in/kwabbza/'

Solar systems that are sold to consumers basically produce no reactive power (which is the part of power that can create a magnetic field it spins motors) and only create real power (which is the part that drives resistive loads it makes heat).  Since youre only making real power the utility has to produce additional reactive power to make up for what youre not making. That has additional cost and its accounted for in your bill.  SRP actually has one of the most advanced models for that cost so even though you think youre paying too much the reality is that its more fair. In many places that additional cost is distributed and effectively added to the rates of homeowners who cant afford to have solar of their own. Stop complaining about paying your fair share.  Rooftop solar as it exists today is basically scam because salesmen expend no effort on learning or explaining how it actually works with the power system as a whole and actively work to distribute the additional costs to people who arent their sales target.','kw1yk8l','/r/phoenix/comments/1bjki35/srp_is_not_regulated_by_the_acc_they_are/kwatu87/'

They have set staging areas where they wait for passengers to book rides.  I assume when theyre low they go to a service center to get charged. They probably dont need to charge as much as you think I believe they only operate in a small part of the valley.  I dont know about the passenger seat.  They havent driven on freeways until recently. If I remember correctly theyre testing freeway operation.  I bet they have automatic windshield wipers set up. Most newer cars have them and its probably easy enough to leave on.

The lowest I believe is $80.  I understand what youre saying and I admit you taught me something new  but the time of use setup is designed in a way to get as much money as possible out of anyone who might barely use any grid power.   And my system is messed up and always kicks in 30 minutes late every Friday (5 months now Ive been waiting for tesla support to help) which is causing me to accrue fees.','kwatu87','/r/phoenix/comments/1bjki35/srp_is_not_regulated_by_the_acc_they_are/kwauvh2/'

There is always a human within quick reach. One time our Waymo got briefly lost at dead end so we pressed the “Contact Support” button on the User touchscreen. A human answered listened to our concern that the car was confused then assured us it would get back on track soon. Sure enough it got back on the correct route within a few seconds. In my experience Waymos are no worse than Uber or Lyft in terms of price safety and convenience.

There will be a computer on the vehicle that uses data from the various cameras and other sensors to determine in real time the state of the vehicles position and surroundings. Some of this will be based on AI models the car was trained on.   The decisions for stopping/going/turning or anything else related to driving have no reliance on internet connection but its possible they use it when available.  If theyre anything like my company the machines are  thoroughly tested with a huge importance on safety over all else. Getting the vehicle to always stop when theres an issue but rarely stop when its safe to go is basically the biggest challenge my company faces.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmc9zv/i_rode_in_a_waymo_today_and_have_some_questions/kwazfvs/'

First I had an issue with keeping an internet connection so I moved my modem from the corner by my tv to the top of my tall bookshelf. Didnt have much of an issue after. Now all of a sudden Im having this problem again? Im about to metaphorically toss my old desktop out my window. This is ridiculous. I cant even do customer service for my sisters photography business if I cant keep internet. My internet has been going on and off on and off all day.

GCU eventually reached a settlement in the case and was forced to pay a $5.2 million fine to a former employee and the federal government.  > In 2023 the Department of Education fined the company $37.7M for deceiving students about the cost of doctoral degrees. The department alleged that 78% of students graduating in those programs paid about 25% over the cost that GCU represented with much of the extra charges accumulating from additional continuation classes for completing the dissertation requirement. Only 2% paid the represented cost. The school disputed the allegation claiming in addition that it provides more information than is legally required. GCU is the largest recipient of Federal student aid. In addition to the fine the department imposed conditions on the school to continue participating in the federal student aid programs.  > Also in 2023 the Federal Trade Commission filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Grand Canyon University deceived prospective doctoral students about the cost of its program and its for-profit status. The suit asserted that the university paid 60% of its revenues to the for-profit Grand Canyon Education company being the most significant source of revenue for the for-profit company. The university and company shared the same CEO.  The school is super shady about the for-profit/non-profit status and the relationship between Grand Canyon University and its parent company Grand Canyon Education company.','kwb2vvq','/r/phoenix/comments/1bma7cy/how_does_gcu_get_in_the_march_madness_tournament/kwb3efe/'

They are a nationally accredited school and not a regionally accredited school. Regionally accredited schools have a higher educational standard that is transferable and recognized not only regionally but often globally as well. They just have a more vigorous standard that is set across all of the same accredited schools. Nationally accredited schools are a little looser with requirements that shift across educational models. There are still quite a bit of industries that will not accept a nationally accredited degree when one is a requirement. A bunch of them have a habit of pushing under-performing students through the system to have a higher graduation rate and look more successful than they are. Many of them have been sued over this. I’m not one to judge someone’s school or career choice but… there can be a big difference in accredited degrees when competing in a job market.','kwardir','/r/phoenix/comments/1bma7cy/how_does_gcu_get_in_the_march_madness_tournament/kwb5217/'

Humans at the control center will only get involved or intervene if there’s an anomaly of some kind to resolve. They have operations center where all the cars return to charge and any repairs can also be carried out if necessary. Quite a large fleet now! Yes you can ride in the front passenger seat for a total of 4 passengers. They’ve started freeway rides just in recent months but only in limited trials at quiet times the goal is to get freeways covered entirely within the next year which will really start to reduce some journey times.  Same goes for airport drop-offs they’re doing them at certain times - think of these things like a ‘soft start’ where the system is learning as it goes and increasing capacity.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmc9zv/i_rode_in_a_waymo_today_and_have_some_questions/kwb6ja7/'

Also Waymo is accurate with their time. When it says pick up in 11 minute I’m getting picked up in 11 minutes. Lyft (especially) and Uber times are more of a *suggestion*.   You can sit in the front passenger seat. It’s where I usually sit when by myself.   You can transport things like luggage or even a bike in the cargo area.   They are testing freeways. Currently with a passenger they will always have a specialist riding with when on the freeway. I don’t know when they will (if ever?) open up freeway riding.   AFAIK the car does all computing on board. This is actually a limitation. It isn’t generating decisions realtime with some sort of AI program it’s following a massive complicated algorithm. This takes less computing power vs an AI driver but makes it vulnerable to errors within the algorithm (see the time a tow truck was hit by two separate waymos during a single drive).   It can be frustrating taking only surface streets. But my best waymo experience was 3 AM NYD after leaving a club. It safely took me across Phoenix I reclined the seat and took a “nap” all for like 15 bucks and didn’t have to make small talk to anyone. ','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmc9zv/i_rode_in_a_waymo_today_and_have_some_questions/kwc9bbh/'

We rode from IKEA to Pei Wei on Ray Road and then back to IKEA after lunch. My wife was trepidatious on the first ride but on the way back she felt much safer. I was giddy the whole time. Amazing technology.  So some questions. Not really expecting any answers but would love to hear others experiences with Waymo. It appears all the cars in Phoenix are electric Jaguars.   Is the car connected to the internet or is all the decision-making happening right there in the car as it happens? If it’s connected to the internet what happens if it hits a dead spot? For this reason I presume the car is making all the decisions.  Where and how do they recharge? Looks like the range is 250ish miles so they are probably needing to charge 2-3 times a day.  Can someone ride in the front passenger seat?  Are they allowed on the freeway?  Both our rides were on surface streets.  If it’s raining do the car run the windshield wipers for it’s own benefit to make the passengers feel safer or not at all?  It was a wild experience especially navigating parking lots.

Someone had pulled close enough behind the Waymo that it couldn’t back up out of the intersection.   It put the hazards on and someone came on the intercom system to ask what happened. A notice popped up on the screen saying a tow truck/AAA type service would be there in 15 minutes. From what it seemed like the support person didn’t have control over what the car was deciding was the best course of action and in a case where cars are truly stuck someone has to come out and manually drive it to safety.   But obviously the light eventually turned green and it turned like it was supposed to.','kwaudo4','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmc9zv/i_rode_in_a_waymo_today_and_have_some_questions/kwcptqm/'

The car still steers itself on its own. Cruise cars were being taken over like this 3-5 times per trip seamlessly I believe. I don’t know if Waymo is having as many interventions.   They aren’t on the highways yet but soon. They are limited to driving only on pre-programmed routes that are “easy” for a computer to drive.   250 miles of electric range is probably enough for a whole day if not more than 1 day. 250 miles of electric range is a lot. (If they were recharging 3 times a day (750 miles) that would be 275000 miles of driving per year.)','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmc9zv/i_rode_in_a_waymo_today_and_have_some_questions/kwcrha8/'

It also makes a difference if the property has a contract with a pest control company that regularly sprays pesticide to prevent an infestation.   I used to live in an apartment with a German roach problem and they did have a pest control contract. They treated my apartment but it didnt work. Sticky traps are worthless. Bait traps are better. You have to take out the whole colony.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmp0gm/roaches_and_moving/kwda3s3/'

Back in the day I heard boilers make that kind of noise and it was usually from an air pocket trapped in the system that had to be drained out. Plus if you allow the settlement to stay in the system you can get calcium deposits to where it will plug the lines and then pretty soon youll be doing some other plumbing chores and just besides replacing your hot water heater. Before I retired in this valley I seen copper lines and homes so plugged with hard calcium deposits they were totally corroded shut and had to be replaced.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bm33im/hard_water_sediment_in_heater_how_often_to_flush/kwdaxsh/'

It got me mad paranoid I cleaned every day and scrubbed. When packing I was able to take these smaller boxes from work(14x10½x7). I pretty much packed things wrote the contents with sharpie on the outside. And took packing tape to seal corners edges creases. It felt overboard but I was super desperate not to take any of them with me. I got to the new place in a rough area and was pretty roach free. I did get an occasional 2-3 every other month or so. But they werent german just regular gross bois.   I think its just apart of apartment living. If your budget allows I would avoid big box apartments. You know like the ones that are huge blocks 2-3 stories in height. Because pretty much if someone gets roaches or bedbugs. Its near impossible to get rid of them. Id opt for maybe single level small Casita style places. Smaller easier to manage. That kind of thing.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmp0gm/roaches_and_moving/kwdbys7/'

Feeding feral cats is not doing them any favors as most experts will tell you. Anyway back then I called every organization I could find on the internet and got zero help. So we had to go the route of getting a lawyer and getting an order against her to stop releasing feral cats and our neighborhood it was hard and it was costly. I also double wired my gable vents cuz the last thing you want is some mama cat having babies in your attic cuz then the fun will begin. Back in the 90s at an apartment complex we owned that was three stories tall one had babies that had fallen down into the walls and I had TV news people there that humane society there and everybody telling me ooh what a good guy I was for capturing the babies and that little escapade cost $10000.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bm8phx/feralstray_cats/kwdbyx2/'

Last summer when it was 120° outside my day I set my thermostat at 78° during the day in 76 at night and was perfectly comfortable. And make good use out of my ceiling fans just remember to change the rotation to counterclockwise in the summertime. Plus before I retired a couple years ago I put in a brand new high efficiency heat pump which is the best AC unit to use in this area. I also bought top of the line dual pane windows throughout. Ive got great shade trees because the sun sets more to the north in the summertime and so I get shadows cast upon the west side of my place. I do not run high Merv rating air filters either but heres a little tip I do to where you dont go out and have to buy them fancy air cleaners. Get you a couple box fans depending on size of your home and put high merv filters to where they pull in the air from and they will keep your air perfectly clean in your home. This will even help you pot smokers. LED lights throughout the house as youll be surprised how much heat a regular light bulb can generate. Those of us who were born and raised in the desert I guess maybe our bodies are different than people that come from cold climates Im not a scientist so I dont know. Many people over Merv rate their air filters for their AC systems but usually on most AC system Merv 8 is the sweet spot. Good luck to you all in the summertime and I hope you have a good one.','kw4oaru','/r/phoenix/comments/1ble08l/whos_using_ac_already/kwdft4o/'

Make sure your bed frame has DE on the legs. Also apply on desk legs. Close the bleach gallon after leaving it open for a day. And no bugs survive 1 day here. Even mosquitoes are susceptible since they walk on the DE. I’ve only seen one roach in my last 3 years. I grew up in an awful neighborhood with roaches rats bed bugs ticks snakes scorpions.

There have been times that someone remotely takes over to navigate like in a tricky parking lot.   Originally in Phoenix it was just surface streets. Last year they tested freeway driving with a waymo employee in the driver seat. Then this year they enabled rider only freeway driving! Pretty big. I’ve been in one that took the freeway.   https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2024/01/08/waymo-to-begin-rider-only-testing-on-phoenix-freeways/72149730007/?utm_source=azcentral-dailybriefing-strada&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dailybriefing-greeting&utm_term=hero&utm_content=pphx-phoenix-nletter02   Our Waymo One fleet consists entirely of fully electric Jaguar I-PACEs — the world’s first premium electric autonomously driven vehicle.   At Waymo we’re focused on building the Waymo Driver which is how we refer to our autonomous driving technology. There are two pieces to the Waymo Driver: hardware and software. On the hardware side we have a sensor suite that includes lidar cameras radar and a powerful AI compute platform. Collectively they provide a 360-degree view of the world. On the software side we take all of the information our sensors collect to answer four key questions: Where am I? What’s around me? What will happen next? And what should I do? Together our hardware and software work in concert to paint a complete picture of the world around the car and enable us to navigate roads safely.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmc9zv/i_rode_in_a_waymo_today_and_have_some_questions/kwe6zdm/'

Unfortunately your submission was removed as it violates our rules:  **Rule 10. No fundraising self-promotion or spam**  We consider spam not just anything directly promotional but also anything intended to generate interest for a business cause website or effort when the original poster is not a regular member of the community. Since this forum is “About Phoenix By Phoenix” we also consider accounts that mass-post links across Reddit to be spam.    We do not allow any fund raising links or posts asking for money. We also do not allow posts of referral code and similar promotions as businesses have used those as advertising ploys. We also do not allow posts for petitions or signature/name gathering.  If you have rarely (or never) posted in the sub before and your first post is promotional it will likely be removed as spam. The guideline we use is no more than 1 in 10 posts someone makes should be about their own content.    You can read all of the [subreddit rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/wiki/rules).

At 16.5K which is the low end prior to taxes you will be paying just over 33K over 20 years.  you also failed to mention if this is a long term home improvement loan a lease or a PPA. If it is either of the latter two avoid those at all costs I am assuming a loan since you mention tax credits you wont get any tax credit with a lease or PPA.   Figure out your estimated energy costs over 20 years use your history as a baseline. energy costs are expected to go up by 50% by 2050 so add an additional 10% to the cost every 5 years. You will need to account for new or growing kids work from home buying an EV etc how long you plan on staying at your house. compare that to the system cost and figure out if it is worth paying cash for or a standard 5-7 year home improvement loan.  Solar only works economically if you have a large monthly bill plan on living at  your current residence for longer then the cost of the system. you are prepaying for energy you will use 10-20 years from now.

They arranged to have pest control spray my new apartment right before I moved in and then I had them come back and spray as soon as i could after moving in in case I had stow-aways.

We’ve had the system for about 7 years now.  We did have to pigeon proof the house those critters like nesting under and around panels.  The tax benefits meant we paid no federal taxes for the first 3 years.  So a gain there as well.  Panels that aren’t leased can add some value to the house although I think it’s somewhat negligible.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmtrpl/solar_estimate_help/kwexp3q/'

Depending upon how many family members you have and the condition of your hot water heater that can be pretty good savings for a relatively small investment.  The other thing that seems effective to me but Ive never seen a cost comparison is a mini-split AC unit that runs on a DC motor which can be powered directly by solar PV. Get an oversized array for the mini-split and power that directly to take some of the load off of your whole-house AC. If you wish use it to charge batteries so you can have the split working at night note that the DC motor will wear faster in the morning and evening hours as the PV array doesnt satisfy the voltage requirements so the batteries would also extend the life of the split.  To me it seems that would be the greater ROI than a rooftop full of PV panels which in turn may require roofing repairs first.

At the apartments I live is completely gated and there are the most crazy lunatic drug addicted people out front constantly 24/7. They are smoke fentanyl right there there are shootings  stabbings every night right out of our gate. Multiple cars a week get stolen from our gated community and also break ins are daily. I’ve had my car broken into at least 10 times in  3 years. I have had people laying out front of my door overdosing. This place at least downtown area is an absolute nightmare and disgusting place to live. Homeless everywhere at all times. Trash everywhere.

I lived in Costa Mesa for 9 years and I would way rather pay expensive rent then have to pay expensive rent in the middle of literal hell on earth. But my daughter is here so I will have to suffer until she is old enough to move away. If you don’t live down here then you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about. This is place is definitely one of the worst places to live in the United States as far as safety cleanliness and quality of life. It’s so expensive here for everything. Food cost just as much as Hawaii. Yesterday I was grocery shopping and there was cheap non organic or even quality chicken that costa 19 dollars for three chicken breast yea 3.

They made a nest in my water dispenser the back of my fridge and my keurig. OP get on your apartment managements ass for pest control.  What helped us of course was having our complex send out pest control to spray our unit (weekly) and then bomb it. Cleared everything out. All cabinets closets bathroom kitchen anywhere where a roach had been spotted ONCE got cleared. Take advantage of when everything is moved out. Seal any gaps. Gaps in the baseboard around outlets cracks in the floor under the lips of counter tops. Move your appliances out of the way and seal back there. Once everything has been bombed again take advantage of everything being moved and clean tf out of everything. Roaches HATE the smell of simple green and its a wonderful cleaning agent and relatively affordable.  Never leave food out. Even our pet water bowls and food bowls had to be picked up off the ground. Cover everything or clean it immediately. Use citrus peels in the drain they hate the smell. I ran a diffuser with rosemary oil 24/7 safe for cats and dogs and roaches hate the smell.  It took months of aggressive treatmsnt and watching roach motels for traffic and clues on where they were coming from and going in to. We have been roach free for 3 months. It can be done but it takes a lot of work.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmp0gm/roaches_and_moving/kwfrp9o/'

To be fair she is an executive chef but it wasn’t really the food that dropped the rating.   When I made the reservation I indicated it was for our anniversary and confirmed that again when they contacted me ahead of time. We waited 30 minutes after we were seated for anyone to come to the table to greet us. It was so long I honestly started to wonder if we’d slipped through the cracks.   Otherwise the service was very good. The ambience is very very good. The courses were good except both our entrees were a bit of a letdown. Nothing terribly bad just not up to par with what I’d expected considering the experience they’re selling. If you want a fantastic experience maybe consider Anhelo in downtown.  Either way I’d strongly suggest for after dinner cocktails you get a basement bar reservation at Barcoa Agaveria and try any drink on the menu. The Elote Moda is especially good and the ambience is a real good time.  Happy anniversary and I hope whatever you decide is amazing.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmt1qz/quiessence_at_the_farm/kwfzmsd/'

You may be able to deduct the cost of these upgrades. Another potential deduction would be specialized shingles designed to improve the efficiency of the solar panels. Certain roofing materials such as metal or asphalt shingles that meet Energy Star requirements may qualify you for a 10 percent federal tax deduction. This deduction does not fall under the solar tax credit but rather the Non-Business Energy Property Tax Credit.  Note that the tax credits mentioned above do not include installation costs.

First year is the hardest but you do fine. Do your stuff early morning if at all possible. Like walking the dogs. After sundown it’s still too hot. Concrete retains heat.   As others mentioned sun screen hats sunglasses. (Get polarized). I can’t stress sunglasses enough. I had cornea damage the first 6 months moving here. UV index is off the charts here. A windshield screen is ideal. Car craft makes them custom per vehicle. Spendy but damned good. Tint your windows. We allow driver doors to be tinted as well (not as dark as rear) it does help.   We do have a lot of indoor venues and pretty much the town is built for the climate. But you will need to take some extra efforts for energy savings. Blackout curtains help in summer. Portable ac units for hotspots in your house if you need. Swamp coolers in your garage are nice.   Other weird things that you will notice. No your water isn’t broken in the summer. There just isn’t any cool water coming out your cold water tap. It’s normal to have 100+ degree cold water. It’s good to keep a supply of cold water in your fridge. And pay attention to your clothes and avoid cold water wash only. They will shrink.   100 is easy here. I can wear a long sleeve shirt and pants while sitting in the shade outside and not sweat a drop now. If you have a fan and misters on outside at 100 it’s downright pleasant.   By this time next year you will be seasoned for 110 before you start to complain.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwi1gd9/'

(I moved here from a cold place and Im scared lmao)','Stay in the shade at all times drink enough water that you wonder whether youre drinking TOO much water and plan your schedule (at least for any outdoorsing and eventually even just errands) around when its coolest.  Staying out of the sun is the easiest way to bear the heat. Its still hot once the sun goes down but at least the sun isnt directly cooking you then. I successfully kept doing things outside in the evening through June most years but eventually the lows get so obnoxiously hot that doing anything but jumping in water still feels bad even at 5am. At that point being on the river or the lakes preferably early is the only thing that helps. It gets you out of the heat island effect and the evaporative nature of hot air makes the water really refreshing.  After that plan trips out of town. You can get to better temps within a few hours drive easily. One good way to plan this is to look at places with higher elevation and then kind of slowly start working your way to higher and higher elevations as the summer temps get worse. That way you explore a lot of places and find cooler and cooler weather.  I always liked and was active through winter so losing a whole season here for the summer was never an improvement on the cold for me. A lot of people insist its universally better because theyd lose the winter every year as if they cant fathom other people not just holing up for months at a time like they did. If you are used to being active year round the claim for year round outdoor recreation in the valley will land as a lie when you lose summer (unless you discover that you love the heat after all or are willing/able to travel constantly).','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwi2dm0/'

(I moved here from a cold place and Im scared lmao)','Just moved here from NC which is pretty hot but Arizona is next level hot. Couple of pointers I’ve picked up …  1. Invest in very very lightweight wicking clothing. In summer there are many misters which really help when you re wearing that kind of fabric.   2. Buy and wear a lightweight wide brimmed hat. Keeps the sun off your head directly and shades your face which helps a lot. (Also: WEAR SUNSCREEN)   3. Stay inside! Just like terrible snow storms I would not go out in I too hunker down indoors with AC of course when it’s the worst and just stay put.   4. Start getting up super super early. In the summer I am routinely up before 6 out walking at 7:30 or grocery shop etc when it’s already 85 or 90. By 9-10 am I go to hunker down mode.   5. Lastly what they say about a dry heat is a lot more bearable than a lower but more humid heat? Absolutely true. I can easily tolerate 100 here no problem but 100 at home in NC destroyed me.  So that’s a big difference in your favor.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwi2zx8/'

Let your body acclimate to it. Stay hydrated wear a hat and apply the sunscreen like your life depended on it (because it does). Im not saying go running at noon when its 110 but dont hide from the heat like it was some kind of toxin. I know people who have lived in Phoenix for decades and never got used to the heat because they stay inside all damn day. I dont know about you but that seems like a terrible way to live life.   I learned this when I moved from Arizona to Pennsylvania and had to deal with cold for the first time. That first winter I stayed inside and was miserable. Every time I had to go out it was new to me and it sucked as much as the first time. The second winter I just kept living my normal life as the cold weather settled in and - lo and behold - I got used to it. By the third winter I was bike commuting in 0 degrees no problem. The same thing applies here - let your body acclimate because it will the human body is crazy good at stuff like this given the chance.   Also whoever told you that being white made it worse is the kind of idiot you should never listen to again please dont bring that crap to Phoenix with you.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwi4x40/'

It should take you 1-2 years of living in this state to start getting used to the summer heat. Even if youre used to the climate like a lot of us youre not immune to getting heat strokes or getting fucked up by the sun so try to not overdo things  Try to spend some time outside so you can start getting used to the heat but dont overdo it. drink a lot of water and plan your days accordingly with the heat especially if you plan to do outdoor activities   In terms of your skin color I do recommend wearing sun screen everyday day that you go outside. I mean Im Mexican and Im brown a lot of my friends and family always say its weird seeing me put on sunscreen cause im brown but that shit helps so much with keeping your skin looking nice after work and protecting you from the sun.   I always use sunbum for work and just going outside I love that sun screen and I recommend you try it out if youre not used to wearing sun screen.

(I moved here from a cold place and Im scared lmao)','You will slowly acclimate to the weather but for your first summer  Stay indoors for the majority of it. Your first month’s electric bill in the summer will give you a heart attack - it’s just the cost of staying cool and worth every nickel. I usually keep my place around 75 consistently. To that point if you go into an office do not turn your AC off during the day to try and save money it costs more to get your house from 88 to 75 than it does to just keep it at your desired temp 24/7.   When you go out try and do things in the early mornings (the coolest part of the day). When you have to go to the store or run errands park under trees or shaded areas buy and use a windshield cover and crack your windows about a quarter inch. This will no joke keep your car 40+ degrees cooler than if you just park in the sun with all the windows rolled up. If you’ve got the money tint your windows (that will keep your car cooler by a few degrees on its own).   Drink a shit ton of water. Like no joke the “8 cups a day” is for people in the north east. Double that in the summer. If you have to do stuff like yard work or any other form of outdoor activity triple that.   Contrary to popular belief wearing loose fitting/breathable long sleeved clothing (cottons) will keep you cooler than a tank top and shorts (you’ll notice all of the guys doing construction all wear long sleeves). Rock a hat and invest in a quality pair of sunglasses.  If you’re going to the pool or even just walking around: sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen.  Try to limit outdoor activity overall until you know how to handle the heat (for things like playing a round of golf) and for the love of god do not do any strenuous activities like hiking or running. People die here hiking every summer because they over estimated how tough they thought they were.  Finally: while not required I highly recommend you make friends with someone that has access to a summer home in the mountains and invite yourself up there every chance you get lol.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwi6j6e/'

The only way to really get after them is to attack all of the apartments in a given building. You can bomb all day long but if the place next door is where they are nestling it wont mean squat for you except that you get to clean up a ton of dead roaches. This MUST be how it is approached. If the apartment complex owner wont do it then there is zero guarantee (unless all the people in the same building decide to band together and do it on their own (or pay someone to do it for them)).','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bmp0gm/roaches_and_moving/kwi967v/'

(I moved here from a cold place and Im scared lmao)','I grew up in the mid-South it wasnt unknown to hit 100+ with 70-80% humidity. I think the main difference is that when its hot and humid you feel terrible (sticky gross miserable) immediately and thats your signal to get inside. It sucks out there.  In very low humidity your bodys cooling systems work much better - sweat evaporates as fast as you can produce it - so you feel *really good* until dehydration catches up with you at which point you feel incredibly bad and are already experiencing a medical emergency. Thats why the stories you hear about dead tourists follow the same pattern - theyre confident outdoorspeople they wanted to go mountain biking and then suddenly starting acting confused and died during the medevac.  Being from Montana youre probably used to being weather-aware in a way that northeasterners arent and know you cant just vibe your way through certain conditions. Its just *different* extreme weather that you need to be aware of.  * Drink water before youre thirsty. Do not wait to hear about it from your body. If you are out for a walk/hike in warm weather turn back before you hit the half-way on your water even if you feel fine. * Watch where you park where you leave things like hoses full of water and metal objects that will turn into scald hazards if they sit in the sun all day. Get your groceries out of the car quickly get packages off your porch timely. Things will thaw/melt faster than you thought. * Good modern window tints block both ultraviolet *and* infrared spectrum so they make a big difference in heat build-up in your car without such a huge impact on visibility. * Dont underestimate exertion. Climbing a couple flights of stairs in the sun doesnt look like much from the bottom if youre feeling good but at the top youll be surprised at how fast you heated up. Pools that were in the sun all day can still be bathtub-warm after sunset and not only might not cool you off the way you hope but might make you feel pretty ill if you swim hard. * Put your sunscreen on. Wear your hat. Theres usually not really a good reason to be in the sun during the mid-day. People do lots of their day-to-day summer errands here in the morning and late evening.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwibiet/'

Also use a sun blocker on the dash of your car.  Having shade around your home can help cool it so plant shrubs trees or purchase those sail shades.   In the hottest summer months it will be too hot to go in the pool.    Never go on a hike in the heat.  Purchase one of those vests that hold ice packs for hot days where you need to be outside.   Never leave the house without water.  Always wear sunscreen and a hat can be helpful too.   Know that the electricity bill will be very high from about May-September and check every bit of your home and seal all cracks and even cover windows that have sun exposure.   Have a plan B. You might decide that its not worth it and you might need to move. Prescott Valley/Prescott is only an hour away and never gets hotter than 95.   Always take a light weight jacket in the summer months because when youre shopping inside the air conditioning can be a bit too cold at times.   Never walk your dog without bringing water for it to drink (collapsible bowls are great) and put doggie shoes on its feet because the pavement is way too hot even on days where its 80. Never leave your dog outside unattended especially if its a small dog and never let your cat go outside. Lots of coyotes owls and wild cats.   Bonus info- Never ride a bicycle on the city streets. Nobody here is used to having pedestrians or bicycles on their radar ever. People in Phoenix and surrounding areas drive very aggressively very fast and very selfishly. It is one of the top 10 most dangerous cities to ride a bike in.   Good luck.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwic7np/'

I moved here from Denver about 5 years ago. Some things that helped me my first summer:  If you have access to a community pool or apartment pool I love to go swimming early in the morning. It’s a nice way to embrace the summer and have fun also not overheat. I find when it’s 110+ not even a pool can cool you down.   Also if you have time get up early and go on walks in the morning before work (when it’s still 80-90 outside). This helped acclimate me when I first moved here. Some people told me to try and get outside for 10 minutes a day when it’s HOT to acclimate but idk if that did anything.  Keep doing things: Yes it’s always more pleasant to stay inside in the summer but that doesn’t mean you have to stay home for months. Some fun indoor things I love to save for summer: art/ceramic classes escape rooms volunteering book clubs.  Day trips day trips day trips. If you’re able to (and like adventuring) summer is the best time to get out of Phoenix and explore higher altitude places. Some of my faves that are less than 3-4 hours away and will be cooler: flagstaff oak creek canyon Prescott Williams. And if you’re okay with a slightly longer drive (5-7hr great for weekend trips): Grand Canyon north rim white mountains strawberry  TLDR: don’t let your life stop in the summer. It’s easy to stay inside all summer and binge TV to stay cool. Keeping life interesting makes summer so much more tolerable.  Also: Drink more water than you think you need then drink some more.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwichn9/'

Gradually raise the temp of your AC so you can acclimate better. If you can get used to it being warm inside your house it will be less of a shock when you step outside. Some people keep their AC at like 72 then go outside into 110 and complain. Duh theyre going to feel hot. Get used to the AC being at 80 and its much less shocking to your body and will save you so much money.  Get an insulated water bottle and carry that with you. Put ice cubes in it but dont fill it with ice as youll run out of water and cant drink ice.   Light clothing is great out here. Dont layer up unless youre really dedicated to your style. Hats are always a plus or sun umbrellas are good. Dont buy black as that obsorbs the heat.   Sunscreen or lotion with some SPF is better than nothing.  Shade from plants is always cooler than man made shades.  Crack windows on opposite sides in your car so the wind will blow out the heat.  Put a washrag or towel on your steering wheel if you park in the sun.  Do laborious stuff in the morning or when the sun has set. The hottest part of the day is the afternoon and onwards as the placement has soaked in the heat.   If you have a dog you walk buy them shoes too.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwigizz/'

Ive lived here a long time and I never have adjusted to it. Also the Seasonal Affective Disorder is alive and well in the summer desert. Things I do to try to stay sane in summer: 1. Estivate. Estivation is the parallel to hibernation. Staying inside in a cool dark place during the hottest part of the season. Pretend its the depths of winter outside and you just cant go out there.  2. Do as much as possible in the early hours. When the cabin fever gets really bad I will frequently get up at 4am and go hiking. The minute the actual sun rises gotta get back inside.  3. Get in pools as much as possible. SHADED POOLS 4. Hydrate','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwijay4/'

Early Summer the humidity will stay low (10% or lower) and it makes it easier to keep cool and it will get cool enough at night so you can spend some time outdoors. Take advantage of this the early Summer because late Summer will keep you locked indoors.  After the monsoon storms in July the average humidity will go up to around 20%. It will be much harder to keep yourself cool and it will stay hot all night.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwinjoz/'

If Im going to be out in the sun I wear long sleeves a hat and spf 100.  If you have a bit darker complexion like some southern Italians or Spaniards you may not have to be SO strict with it but if you are really super white you definitely do.

Most of my family and I we all keep small empty coolers in our trunks or backseats. If there ever is a day where you need to bring things that could melt or explode caps we grab an ice pack and stick it in the cooler. The cooler is also nice to have when you put groceries in the car. Bring water with you wherever you go. Depending on the overcast and temp don’t walk pets certain times of the day especially between 12pm-5pm- their paws will burn. And when you’re sick of the heat and miss Montana head an hour or so north to Prescott where there’s lots to do and many places to eat and drink and be merry.

Drink water. Water not soda.  So long as you stay inside during the worst of it AC takes care of you. Driving is a chore but your car assuming you have one ought to prevent too much hot for you. The metal parts in the cabin will burn you. Beware of that. Good idea to not have leather anything as well. Your steering wheel...thats hot. Put a cover on it.  Itll feel pretty terrible at first but youll quickly adapt and feel good. 110 isnt terrible. 120 is terrible. There are usually only a handful of days at >120 but they do happen. Then the rains come and everything gets worse. Dont drive in the monsoon floods. Those can kill you.   Anyway welcome to AZ.

Booties will just make them overheat because in addition to cooling themselves by panting dogs cool themselves through the glands in their paw pads. With booties on they cant do that because no air is getting to the paw pads.   Our rule here for walking is if you havent walked them by 6:00 AM they arent walking that day. Our senior dogs dont tolerate temps much over 80 or being in direct sun for very long.   I also keep a fan aimed at the dog beds to help cool them off when they come in from the back yard.','kwih3qv','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwj5s6f/'

More than youre used to. Get yourself a decent tumbler or water bottle that will endured you to drink more (I prefer tumblers because Ill drink without thinking about it if it has a straw).   - Even when the weather is nice we still live in a dry climate. Dont go on a hike without a lot of water and still drink a lot of water in the nice months.   - Dont turn your AC off when you leave your house its only going to overwork the unit and drive up your AC bill. I forget if its better to turn it up to a little warmer or just leave it at your preferred temperature but absolutely dont turn it off.   - Get a remote start on your car if you can. Inside your car will be much hotter than outside. You can get some of that extra hot air out by leaving your door(s) open for a minute or so before getting in and/or rolling down all of the windows before the AC gets cold.','kwhxhqn','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwj7pav/'

My previous bank doesnt have branches in this area so Im on the hunt for a new financial institution that offers a competitive interest rate on savings and convenient access to ATMs without hefty fees.  Ideally Im looking for a bank or credit union that not only provides a solid high yield savings account but also has local ATM branches where I can withdraw cash without incurring extra charges. I used to have an auto loan with Desert Financial but after reading some mixed reviews Im a bit hesitant about sticking with them.  So Im turning to the Phoenix community for recommendations. Have any of you had positive experiences with local banks or credit unions offering high yield savings accounts? Id love to hear about your experiences including interest rates customer service and overall satisfaction with the institution.  My main goal is to find a reliable financial partner where I can route my direct deposits earn decent interest on my savings and have easy access to cash when needed. Your insights and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance for your help!','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bnmjo7/best_bank_or_credit_union_for_a_high_yield/kwj9muy/'

(I moved here from a cold place and Im scared lmao)','Rule of thumb: If its not hot the air quality is really bad. If its stifling the air is cleaner.  Although in recent years its pretty bad year round.   Avoid going out unless you absolutely have to in the middle of the day. Its hot even in the middle of the night. You just dont have the sun beating on you.  Block out as much sun as you can in your house.  It will help with your AC bills. Mine were $600 a month to keep it at 84. And that was 10 years ago. (It was a 3400 sq ft house with two units on it).  And Dont beat yourself up if you dont happen to get used to it. For some it is always suffocating. You just learn how to live with it.   Side note if you have scorpions they are more prevalent in the summer.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwjfezx/'

Walking to school in December classmates are all in heavy coats and were in shirtsleeves enjoying a nice summers morning.  Loose clothing in natural fibers is a win. The summer standard for women at one job was a flowing cotton boho-hippy mid-calf skirt and a long-sleeved shirt. (great aeration). A recent hire from Pakistan asked me if we were all Muslimas ... because of the relatively modest dress perhaps.

I was diagnosed at a hospital and I dont have their information anymore. It wasnt a specific doctor if that makes sense I kind of walked in and walked out with a paper saying I have LPR. Numerous people were involved with the test but I never met the doctor(s) so it was a bit confusing. Its a long story but basically got the LPR diagnosis from a swallow exam. The woman who did the exam (a technician or NP not sure) basically kicked me out immediately after I was done despite telling me to ask away while we were walking out. She got impatient after 1 or 2 quick questions.   I went to my PCP for recommendations who I very much trust.

Closed shoes are a good idea.   Bark scorpions are small and hard to see and they can and will sting exposed skin on your feet. The sting feels like an electric shock and can make you sick. They can hide around rocks and gravel. I have been stung twice and felt ill effects for a long time.   Rattlesnakes a/k/a danger noodles are also a thing. Theyre not always easy to see and they dont always rattle. Of course they dont like being stepped on and may strike if they consider you a threat. There are many different species of rattlesnakes in various parts of Arizona and they dont all look the same.  I f you like to explore and hike climbing rocks mountainbiking ATVs etc. get some good  well-fitting boots if you dont already have them.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwjyw50/'

Get a dashboard cover.  It will extend the life of the dash material.  Get a steering wheel cover or learn to drive with oven mitts now.  5.  Door handles hand rails out door metal....all get very very hot.    6.  In the summer you will live like a mole.  The coolest part of the day is before the sun comes up.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwjz27a/'

Got 10 for $515 all custom sized to my windows. They send you the pre-cut frames and solar screen you choose. They sell a sample kit so you can pick the right frame and screen color.   Be sure you measure per their website instructions. I have a big enough island that i was able to build the frames tape down with painter tape to the island and then roll in the screen. Invest in a good rolling tool since you’ll save tons on the total cost. I found it useful to pre-roll the screen into the channel then roll the rubber strip in.   Would order again 100%  Edit to add more info:  Screen over a certain size require a crossbar so be sure to include that if needed. Also I bought one large screen to cover my double hung windows but if I could do it again I would order it in two parts one to replace the existing big screen then another to go over the non-moving part of the window.

(I moved here from a cold place and Im scared lmao)','For your car: Crack your windows get a sun shade for your windshield park in the shade if you can be careful touching anything metal like the seabelt buckles. A trick I learned that helps is as soon as you turn the car on roll your windows down for like 10 seconds and blast your A/C. Itll feel like a convection oven at first but it pushes out all that hot air and makes it easier to cool off the car once your A/C starts to get cold.   For your house: During the day especially if youre not home turning the thermostat up to 76-80 (depending on your tolerance) will help keep your electric bill reasonable. I usually turn it down to 72-74 at night before bed then back up before I go to work in the morning. Light blocking curtains help a lot in the heat of the day as well as a pull-down shade for your patio if youre in an apartment. Try to avoid using your oven. Only do laundry in the morning or at night. APS bills can get wild if youre not careful.   For you: Invest in a daily sunscreen moisturizer for your face/neck and wear high SPF if you know youll be outside for a while. Wear loose breathable clothes including underwear (ya gotta get 100% cotton undies). And most importantly if you take anything away from this thread DRINK DRINK DRINK WATER. Youd be surprised how easy it is to get dehydrated here just running errands. Get an insulated water bottle and keep it full of cool/cold water take it everywhere.  Follow at least some of this stuff and youll be ok. Everyones first summer is rough.

'kwl22c2','2024-03-25 19:13:12','gr8tfurme','1bnvwus','A lot more panhandlers with dogs lately?','I think if someone is panhandling with their dog it means they arent going to be spending a lot of time at a job away from their dog. Feeding the dog is another story but I think them bringing their dogs with them to panhandle also tends to increase the amount of money (and dog food) they get.    Theres a lot of different types of homelessness and panhandling and homelessness dont necessarily go together all the time. Some people who have family to live with will panhandle because they cant hold a job and a lot of homeless people do have a job or otherwise avoid panhandling. Its impossible to say without asking the people doing it and a lot of them wont necessarily give you a straight answer.    Theres rough estimates of how many people sleep in their cars versus In a tent or on the street  but I dont know what the breakdown is for Phoenix.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bnvwus/a_lot_more_panhandlers_with_dogs_lately/kwl22c2/'

If youre going to be exposed for a long time to the sun then wear thin long sleeves. Hat + sunglasses works wonders. Have water with you at all times back up water in different places and know where youre going to get water next. Keep flip flops in the car in case you find yourself without footwear. Otherwise youre stuck. Gloves are not bad either.  Also acclimate yourself. Stay off the AC in the car until you cant bear it anymore. Its a bitch but office workers cant stand in th heat for 20 minutes but blue collar guys can work in it all day. Make yourself part of the desert at a safe pace and that will help a ton.  You should be scared.

Cover your steering wheel. Your buckles? Try to cover or place ice packs on them when you park. Be prepared to touch your handles and other door handles as cautiously as possible. I usually carry a cotton gauze scarf to keep the sun off my exposed skin and that helps with exposed metal in the sun. Just be aware. Asphalt will burn you. Ive literally cooked food on it. Ive hard boiled eggs in water outside (took a few hours but it still worked.) You can also have some fun cooking cookies on your dash. Just put them on a cookie sheet and place on dash. Then wait. They arent delicious though- oddly they taste like... car. But its still a cool novelty. AC bills are almost the same as rent/mortgage. Plan accordingly. Its not too taboo to put insulated foil in windows depending on the HOA. Also get used to the dark. The darker you can keep your space during the day the cooler. Oh!

When it’s freezing outside you generally don’t hang outside too long… same goes for when it’s super hot here. It’s just moving to/from heated building vs. to/from air conditioned building. Having good A/C in your car and house is key though. 115 heat in Arizona is still comfortable inside your home although can get expensive… but I would take that over a 80-90 heat wave in a place that doesn’t have A/C standard.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bng7h2/how_do_i_deal_with_the_heat_i_moved_here_from_a/kwlhhwu/'

Get a motorcycle/scooter for commuting only. Especially if youre young single and its your first vehicle. Low payments low insurance get to build credit on something low risk. Not only that. If just a meager 10% of drivers switched to motorcycles for a daily commute it would clear up 40% of congestion.   Think about it on Grand Ave. Youre at a light. You got all these giant lifted trucks and SUVs basically driving a single person every day commuting. Thats 3 lanes 3 of these vehicles. 1 person per vehicle. Thats the front row at a light an insane misuse of space. Now imagine that same set up with bikes. You got 4 people on 4 bikes per lane that can take up the same amount of room in that front row (Thats 12 vehicles and people!) If theyre at the front they take off quicker and safer and are out of the way for slow clunky standard vehicles behind them. Almost like they were never there or an inconvenience at all!  Now imagine that scenario again. 12 people and 12 standard vehicles. Thats now 4 rows of 3 cars.  So now lets break that down again but bigger!  Say youre driving down the road at any given time. You have 100 cars/trucks/suvs in front of you each with a single driver with 3 lanes available. That equals 33.3 rows of 3 vehicles with a single driver commuting. Basically what we see every day. Okay okay! Stick with me. Now take 100 people on bikes 12 people per row with the same math. Thats 8.3 lanes. You ever see 8 rows of cars at a stop light and know youre gonna get through when it turns green next?? Yeah thats exciting. Youre gonna get home at a reasonable time. It feels good.

','As someone whos a very libreral/progressive person ranked choice would be amazing for those who actually want to vote their for their respective party.  I think really (and speaking as objectively as possible) there is a huge demand for some Independent Party. But because we are in a [Winner takes all system](https://ballotpedia.org/Winner-take-all) it favors two parties [established](https://www.factcheck.org/2008/01/why-only-two-political-parties/). There are also different laws for registering independents such as write ins. My opinion is that it gives an opportunity for the Libertarians to have a place without being known as the Republicans that like to smoke weed although Republicans now are moreso the MAGA party and not traditonal conservatives. From my knowledge there are some policies that they have to offer that are more fiscal based....but I havent seen anything on the societal scale.  [Heres how it works from NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/13/1214199019/ranked-choice-voting-explainer)  Your best would be reaching out to an organization and getting a [proposition started.](https://www.azcleanelections.gov/arizona-elections/propositions).','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bqfwhk/would_ranked_choice_voting_work_in_arizona/kx2q9mk/'

'kx3g5pw','2024-03-29 04:37:33','DigitalGurl','1bqecs2','Jobs? Career advice?','It really depends on your aptitude. Generally for a life long career I recommend going into water! There are so many jobs in this area. From water or waste water operator or with some education a water resources specialist right of way specialist contract administrator  gps specialist accountant engineer etc.   In this field you will always have a job. (Barring you doing something terrible) Benefits are typically excellent with great sick vacation health life disability insurance and good retirement benefits most municipalities have some sort of education stipend some private companies do but it’s varies.   Typically if you work for a municipality (city or government) you have even better retirement benefits.  For folks with little to no experience or coming from an office or retail background there is customer service billing operations or admin assistant etc.   You could become a water / waste water operator Pay starts off for people with zero experience as OK but as you further your experience and become higher grades the pay increases exponentially.  Maricopa College has excellent water operator / environmental science programs. They are a feeder for water business across the state.   If you take some environmental science courses or hydrology courses you can go into the water testing environmental water conservation hydrology aspects of the business.  I am not over estimating the opportunities in this field right now. A lot of the old timers are retiring and there are not enough people to fill vacancies.  Places to look for jobs are AZ Water Epcor most of the municipalities like City of Scottsdale City of Chandler City of Queen Creek Mesa Avondale etc.. are good places to start. Most water companies have some sort of in-house training programs for water operators.  For training along with Maricopa College ADEQ certifies operators for the state and offers training https://www.azdeq.gov/operator-certification programs. Call or go look online at their water operator training and testing programs. The person in charge of the program is a wealth of knowledge and can point you in the right direction to get started.   Another resources is https://www.azwater.org/page/e_r_opercert  https://www.gatewaycc.edu/degrees-and-certificates/water-resources-and-environmental-science-technology?hsa_acc=6703217988&hsa_cam=16785773921&hsa_grp=137955563729&hsa_ad=591200514934&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-25015600&hsa_kw=environmental%20colleges&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAptEo7JIKnsrrZ7wywmI33nRLEwj5&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3aLKjquZhQMVdwutBh2j6gCuEAAYASAAEgL3WvD_BwE&utm_term=environmental%20colleges&utm_campaign=Environment+Science/Water+-+2022&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc  https://www.maricopa.edu/degrees-certificates/applied-technology/environmental-science-water-resources-technologies-3830-aas','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bqecs2/jobs_career_advice/kx3g5pw/'

Like she was in her mid 20s and fully admitted she was following the instructions of a call she picked up that it was the IRS and she needed to get the gift cards or else.    I also sold gift cards to someone who we found out later was being scammed. I remember asking her straight up about her reason for buying so many gift cards and she vaguely said it was wedding gifts. But she didn’t want them in our fancy gift card boxes no ribbon no cards to write personal messages and didn’t want to enter in her phone number for rewards points (it was enough she would’ve earned like $60 back in store credit). I made the sale and of course she came back 1/2 hr later crying that it was because it was a scam.    So yeah people suck.

Conversations on my morning commute? Nobody wants to talk  Put yourself in their place. In a grocery store do you usually want to or have time to speak to someone else in a foreign language or just go about your day? I usually just wanna get in and out of a grocery store.  Its not personal we just wanna get on with our busy lives.   >Whats there to lose teaching kids/teens another language that they might have a chance of actually using on a daily basis?  You said it yourself youve been here all your life and have tried to learn the language. Theres no crime in teaching them a foreign language but the state of education in AZ isnt great. Lack of (quality) teachers students that dont want to actually learn but want a passing grade..etc. motivation and interest needs to be there for them to be successful in acquiring another language.   I dont have any recommendations because theres plenty online. You need to do the research and figure out what works for you and your learning style.   I think those apps that focus on gammification like Duolingo are utter crap since it makes people focus on keeping learning streaks and other BS instead of actually engaging with the language.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bqj23e/is_there_a_placeprogram_in_phoenix_that_offers/kx44cm5/'

Its definitely frustrating when premiums go up unexpectedly especially without any claims or changes in your circumstances.  As an independent insurance agent I specialize in helping people like you find better rates and coverage options. I work with a variety of insurance companies and Id be happy to shop around for you to see if we can find a more affordable policy that still meets your needs. Sometimes switching to a different provider can result in significant savings without sacrificing coverage.  If youre interested feel free to shoot me a message or email and we can discuss your options further.

If you are getting your windshield replaced every 2-3 years it shouldnt cause any issues with the insurance provider. For cash back the auto glass company is taking the risk not you. However if you deal with an honest auto glass shop like [https://windowrepairphoenix.com/windshield-replacement/](https://windowrepairphoenix.com/windshield-replacement/)  they wont over-inflate the price of your windshield to the insurance provider.

I wish I could have the spare on the driveway and still get the daily out of the garage but of course thats not physically possible.  It sucks to park the daily on the driveway especially with summer coming but that might be the only option. Thats assuming you didnt mean that youre already using both the garage and the driveway before bringing the spare car into the equation.  I know the best part of a garage is that the car you drive everyday isnt 150F when you get in it everyday. But that just might not be in the cards.  When I was in a townhouse I had no driveway so the 2nd car went to the community parking area. But of course thats not an option for you.. So either youre going to have to put the spare in the garage and park the daily on the driveway or maybe in front of a friend/family house where the HOA doesnt care. Last option would be a storage facility though I am not sure what the rules are on parking in a storage unit. Might have to be a RV storage facility.  I wouldnt personally risk parking long term in a shopping center or office lot because youll have to drive by it everyday and make sure you arent getting tickets or towed. I get nervous leaving a car there for just a day let alone potentially weeks or months. And then you have to drive the daily over to get it or walk however far away it is.','kx4lu44','/r/phoenix/comments/1bqo404/parking_ideas/kx4poco/'

Big money or market makers know this and that is a technique hedge funds and private equity collude (indirectly usually but RealPage YieldStar was overt) and they can pump a market which adds more volume which adds more chasers/algorithmic purchasing ([80% of the market is already automated/algorithmic](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/sell-offs-could-be-down-to-machines-that-control-80percent-of-us-stocks-fund-manager-says.html)) and then you can take the market up broadly with only a small lever.  With an inelastic good this is even more prevalent like housing.  Now there were other factors that make the manipulation work better. Lower supply more demand and at the same time private equity was doing the same to housing on the purchasing side not just rental. OpenDoor/Zillow/others all impacted the Phoenix market again by about 5%-10% which is all you need. So you basically had a spitroast on all housing in Phoenix.  The same reason that institutional investors are limited to 10% so should any other type of market maker. They are so what they do is get others into some fold like RealPage YieldStar and you can then control a larger slice. You only need a slice to leverage the entire market especially in inelastic goods. Markets chase movements and the volatility follows and the hedge funds and private equity fronts are professional skimmers.','kx4p67d','/r/phoenix/comments/1bpwp72/rents_across_the_us_grew_for_the_first_time_in_6/kx4tmy4/'

[PMI.](https://www.pmi.org/certifications) One of my favorite careers. Learn more about it and chart a certification path. All levels of jobs. Easily 6-figures after a few years. 2. Phoenix PD. Obviously some issues here but lots of career choices...and incredible benefits. 3. Trades. If you are interested these are great careers. I highly recommend (in order) Plumber HVAC and Electrician. 4. Dispatch (city) for fire and police. Usually will have training on the job. 5. Nursing. Lots of programs to start (at the bottom) and work your way up. Healthcare is a massive industry and only getting bigger. You will have to apply yourself to manage your career. 6. Professional Bartender. Not sure if this works for you (with a kid) but I am friends with a couple of professional bartenders who love it. 25 years in.

If you are your partner are female I would recommend you look it up. You can get a certificate of completion in many advanced manufacturing jobs such as semiconductor composites or cable wire harness and they help with job placement upon completion. Some work with “the route to relief”grants and provide a stipend $1k a month while learning and also offer additional stipends for childcare (I believe $500 but I wasn’t eligible so not sure my kids are too old). I think men can apply for route to relief as well.   The training I completed was for cable wire harness and it was only 2 weeks of class 4-8pm. I got 1k stipend and can use it however I need to. I really want to try to get into the other two programs as you can complete as many as you want. But I am super interested in getting the semiconductor certification since a few manufacturers are already here with more being built.

It’s full time in the evening. 530-1030pm M-F. They do split it up and have zoom and labs a few terms in. So it’s not always zoom. Which is so nice. And you’re scanning before you get to clinicals. The last 6 months is clinicals and they try to work with you but don’t expect to work. It’s 40/week for clinicals. But it’s definitely worth it.   The other option is gurnick. It’s all online. And I believe they have clinicals for a year? However I’ve been working in radiology for a few years now prior to going to school and a lot of the gurnick students come in never being in a healthcare setting before. Some of the techs lack confidence and the skills needed to do the day to day.

Traffic in that area is NOT primarily heading back into downtown. I’d say 70-80% is heading further west towards Avondale/Buckeye etc. So why they put the emphasis on traffic curling back to downtown I have no fucking clue.   Also having the 101 interchange just 3 miles further down creates a lot of weaving traffic. 202 merging in trying to get to the left 101 exiting traffic trying to get to the right. This actually would be a great place to use the Collector/Distributor design and split out traffic for 75th 83rd 91st and maybe even the 101 before that 202 ramp merges in. Then 202 ramp could choose left for outbound 10 or right for those local exits.','kx20pue','/r/phoenix/comments/1bqa2pm/101_i10_and_mcdowell/kx61vbs/'

Banner Honor Health Abrazo Mayo etc.?)','RN here ???????Definitely depends on what your needs are. If you’re looking for primary care i feel it matters most to find a provider you’re comfortable with and stick with them- bonus if they have good receptionists/schedulers/online portals.   For inpatient/acute care…   Dignity: St. Joes/Chandler are level 1 trauma centers and i know Joes specifically is one of the best trauma centers in the state. Joes also has Barrow’s Neuro center which people come from all over the nation to get treatment at. They’re also 1 of 2 centers (the other is Banner U in tucson) in AZ that preform lung transplants and their program is consistently rated quite highly in the region. Dignity did merge with Commonspirit around 5ish years ago so they have slowly been getting more corporate since then. But overall staff seem to be happy to work there.   Banner: overall seems to be great for patient care. They are very protocol/data driven so it can streamline a lot of things and they’re a huge network so they have an incredible amount of resources. BUMCP has a very successful heart transplant program (Mayo is the only other in the state). It’s highly corporate so a lot of employees don’t enjoy that aspect of it. The system > any individual and that’s exactly how you feel as an employee.   Honor Health: i know they have a number of locations throughout the valley and everyone from patients to staff overall really enjoy them. They treat their staff well and have a lot of great providers. Shea and Osborn are really fantastic hospitals-I’m just not sure what specialties they thrive in (other than L&D- everyone wants to have their babies there).   Mayo: is Mayo for a reason. If you have great insurance and it’s non-emergency then you know you’re getting top notch care. But any trauma/emergency situation you have much better options elsewhere.   Abrazo: do not do not do not do not go anywhere near with a 10 foot stick.   Steward: idk how they’re even still operating. They’re in so much debt. Really won’t be surprised when i see news about them shutting the rest of their doors.

Beautiful apartment and bug free. Never have seen a roach. Down side is its way too pricey and extra mandated fees: valet trash smart technology common area utilities conserving fees to take my utility payment. These fees increase my rent by $200 each month.

But if you do know what they are think about what jobs use them and see if you can dip your toes. Get your feet wet into internships entry level jobs and or volunteer positions that use your strengths. See if you like it. If you do ask the people who helped you into that space to explore career paths. I advise this because you seem to be in the exploratory phase and might want to sample before buying. Also sit down with a piece of paper and ask yourself What work would I do **now** if I had the qualifications and credentials? Pretend you miraculously have them. Whats your answer? Maybe you can work towards that or something close.   I found the following helpful for me when I wasnt sure where to start:     [https://www.humanmetrics.com/personality](https://www.humanmetrics.com/personality) An assessment that provides results about your personality type (as it is now) and the jobs you could be a good fit for.       [https://www.literacynet.org/mi/assessment/findyourstrengths.html](https://www.literacynet.org/mi/assessment/findyourstrengths.html) An assessment for observing where your strengths/intelligence currently lay.  The above are free to take btw.

Banner Honor Health Abrazo Mayo etc.?)','I’ve worked at a few so here are my thoughts:  Mayo: it was brief and they do attract some of the top individuals in their respective fields. My experience however is that it is not “real world”. Healthcare workers can get overwhelmed easily there if they get just a little busy and I think that stems from the training. Doctors and nurses generally have a low patient load which results in residents (trainees) having a light patient load which doesn’t often result in great decision making when one is eventually under stress or overworked. Especially for trainees that end up working at other spots in the real world not ideal. Also not my ideal patient population.   Banner: worked here as well. Resources are great which comes from being such a giant corporation. The corporation side of things however make working there kinda shitty things move slow. I’m torn on whether I would want family there because generally care is good but I can also see the sheer numbers that are treated making it easy for a patient to get lost or overlooked.   VA: wow things move slow. Same sort of problem as mayo that the patient load is not real world which in theory is great but in actuality I feel breeds laziness in the doctors and nurses. But since it is the VA they do a great job of incorporating a real multidisciplinary approach to patient care (example acupuncture as part of their pain clinic)  Valleywise: where I’ve worked the most. They do a real good job for a patient population that desperately needs help. They do this with generally limited resources. Employees are pretty happy here despite being somewhat underpaid in comparison to the rest of the spots (nurses I’ve heard have a great pension though). Small enough system that collaborative care amongst various specialities is still possible. Wouldn’t take a family member there for a neuro problem though.  Dignity: Might be the best overall..but their volume can get kind of insane and I do find that their focus on ‘metrics’ occasionally outweighs what a patient actually needs.   Friends at HH seem happy.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bpgakv/what_major_healthcare_corp_is_the_best_in_the/kx7c5v2/'

For reference I drive a 2023 Mazda 3 5k miles. I do carry state minimum. I live in Goodyear and I’m 32 with 2 not at fault accidents in the last 5 years. Can anyone help me understand why my insurance is always so expensive if everyone else I know pays $100+ less and mine is always so expensive even though I don’t have anything bad on my driving record? Also open to any affordable companies as I am currently with Mercury. Thanks a lot????','-','/r/phoenix/comments/15z72z6/what_car_insurance_are_you_guys_carrying/kx7s3db/'

I thought the coverage would be better but I was wrong. Verizon’s home internet is excellent in my area where T-Mobile wasn’t as good.   Verizon will offer you deals but they won’t apply them right away. They say it takes a couple statements to get the discounts. This is odd. On one occasion they were charging me twice for one new phone because they messed up on a number port. It took hours and hours of phone calls to get them to fix it. I had to figure out what they did to convince them it was their mistake. Until then everyone told me I bought two phones. I told them the imei is probably the same on both contracts which was true. Still took me several calls and more hours on the phone to fix it.   Another issue was with a trade in credit. Did two phones and one got more credit. Hours and over several calls over several months and I finally got full credit.    Mint was good but Internet isn’t as fast and travel out of the country is expensive. That was important since we go to Mexico often. Roaming coverage isn’t the same while in the US.','kx6so6p','/r/phoenix/comments/1br4cpw/trying_to_leave_att/kx7s5wz/'

It turns out that none of the North/South roads came close since the only truly long unbroken ones were the highways.  McDowell Rd _would_ have been the longest since it starts in far East Apache Junction and goes to absolutely-nowhere West Valley... but there is a gap in the road right at the Salt River and so its not continuous.  Southern is pretty darn long but not long enough.  The longest was.... <drumroll please>.... Baseline Rd. It is unbroken from far East Valley to far West Valley.

I didnt even no that no glass coverage was an option in AZ!  Of course the rate was lower! The coverage was not the same!  Every interaction w/them was a hassle.  Relationship was terminated after they raised my rate to over $500/mo because they determined my husband 2 be at fault in accident & paid the lady who made an illegal maneuver and barreled into him in a pkng lot! Accident in June raised rate in January when they told me it was too late to appeal it. Convenient. It seems to me like the party who benefitted most from that situation was (obviously the lady who hit him) but liberty mutual for sure tried to be the biggest beneficiary Just saying LibertyMutual lies and doesnt always look out for the best interest of their customers.

Buyers A) suck at being able to envision how it could improve and if they can then B) they don’t want to buy a major home improvement project and if they do then they C) will want the cost of the flooring job deducted plus a premium for the hassle of having to do it themselves. In short you’ll have to reduce it more than the cost of just getting the work the done.   Your alternative is to put a flooring allowance credit as an incentive on the listing.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1brs11t/selling_my_house_with_saltillo_tile/kxbv8fi/'

Looked like it hadn’t been sealed since it was installed decades ago the floors looked grimy no matter what we did.  Parts had been chipped and either left alone or filled in with grout.

I bet it was great the first 5-10 years it was open. They invested in attractions instead of improving the park to be less cruel and more approachable for guests.   Now they just have run down attractions and exhibits. It almost feels more like they are displaying the animals for sale vs keeping them in appropriate environments for long term stays.   Phoenix zoo honestly is 99% better than world wildlife. The only difference is world wildlife has an aquarium. (It’s not a great aquarium either) There are much better zoos across the us than the Phoenix zoo. So If you’ve been to somewhere like San Diego zoo or Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha Phoenix Zoo is a bit disappointing. But it’s not a bad zoo at all. In fact I haven’t gone back in 5 years. Maybe will consider going back in a few weeks. Maybe they finished some of the projects they were working on.','kxccs0e','/r/phoenix/comments/1brqem0/best_zoo/kxcewh7/'

Hobbs signs bill making Pluto Arizona’s official state planet','This state could use a little brevity right now as well as demonstration of intelligence given we’re 45th in education. Meanwhile GOP legislators have been introducing such important laws like:   SB1042 - Wendy Rogers - “Donald Trump Day” SB1184 - AZ GOP - “eliminating tax on rentals” SB1305 - No shocker here - “critical race theory in public schools”  SB1250 - religious exemption to vaccines  HB 2572 - social credit scores  SB 1600 - reporting requirements for abortion  …..this list goes on of stupid shit introduced in the past 4yrs.   How anyone is triggered over something that is so uniquely Arizona and a nod to our fairly revolutionary past and contribution to science….is pretty mind boggling. If anything I see this as a great move by her as a publicity stunt to demonstrate to all the tech. companies coming in and their typically highly educated and technical staff that we know we’re kind of idiots in the space of public education….but we’re going to take steps to work on it.   Meanwhile Biggs Rogers and Gosar are doing everything they can to make our state look as stupid as possible to anyone who has acknowledged a history book written after 1950 and doesn’t romanticize the 1800’s - which “Arizona” was still a part of Mexico then.

Another perk was they purchase the items needed to help with the organization and you choose what fits your budget and style and they take back the rest for you.

She sold her home and the whole thing had this tile. The people who bought it wanted to buy everything in the home too. It had a ton of style and character. People might just be reacting to the overall vibe of your house.

','How long shave you had it listed and is it priced appropriately(I know that means something different to everyone)?  By appropriately I mean have you found the same or similar layout square footage home in your neighborhood that sold recently that has the flooring recently renovated and taken that and other differences in renovations features and lot size into account appropriately? Usually realtors are decent at doing this but sometimes they aren’t or they encourage or go along with pricing higher in case someone is willing to pay it which is fine if you’re willing to wait around for a buyer but you really want to avoid having to do price cuts because the home is priced too high.   I’m right in the process of selling my home and I found houses that were in my neighborhood that sold started deducting and adding to the price based on what my house had and came to a range of where I thought my house could sell and then listed it in the middle-low range of that primarily because I wanted to move it quickly and I got under contract in 4 days.   As to you renovating it I wouldn’t you won’t recoup that cost and whatever you put down still likely won’t be to 50% of buyers tastes. And on top of that there are people out there that really like this tile and you could be alienating those people that would have preferred this flooring. So it’s really just better to take into account what it would cost to rip this out and replace it with new tile or wood floors and take that into consideration when pricing your home. It is not worth the cost or effort for you to redo the floorings let the buyers do it.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1brs11t/selling_my_house_with_saltillo_tile/kxcorz5/'

','I actually also think the Saltillo is fine especially in Arizona and isn’t especially dated.   The problem is that this whole room is dated when you put the different pieces together. The weathered white wood the floor the tile the style of the wood and cabinetry and the accents all combine into that “Tuscan Italian” trend that was the rage for like 1-2 years in the late 90s. That is what’s making this look dated especially because that trend is not one that ended up being “timeless” like some others.','kxb44wu','/r/phoenix/comments/1brs11t/selling_my_house_with_saltillo_tile/kxehw3n/'

I’m certain there’s multiple Canadian buyers who will be charmed by the styling.   But honestly I’ve never understood the dislike of saltillo tile. It’s regionally appropriate - both because of Phoenix homes’ typical architectural style (even the stucco track homes have a touch of southwest styling) and our cultural ties to Mexico. Not to mentionsaltillo has had an interesting history. The constant need to renovate a home’s durable elements to look exactly like everyone other home often feels wasteful and boring.

All the roads leading up north shift over about 500ft. Always wondered.','I accept the curvature of the earth is real but I’m not sure it’s the ‘cause’ of the shift below baseline. Maybe it is but I was always under the impression it was due to slightly incorrect surveying in old Chandler and Gilbert from before the grids actually touched each other.  Imagine a grid in Phoenix that is growing outward and a grid in the east valley that is growing outward (with the planned intention of eventually meeting and aligning with the grid from Phoenix). But an east-west measurement was off someplace over the course of a 20 or so mile gap. So that when the grids came into contact they were slightly off and had to have a jog put in to make them align.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bru5rh/does_anyone_know_why_the_street_grids_between/kxerlt5/'

'kxf6tji','2024-03-31 10:12:25','SatanicRainbowDildos','1brrm3e','Gov. Hobbs signs bill making Pluto Arizona’s official state planet','Nope. It’s past the statute of limitations. Pluto not being a planet is the new normal and people who want to stop Arizona from recognizing it as its official state planet are being fuddy duddies.   If in the future some idiot tried to make Arizona’s official state planet Uranus then the people who complain about switching it from Pluto can be called fuddy duddies.   As for being dumb they are being dumb. If their preference is to make Mars or Uranus or gasp Earth the official state planet then they are entitled to that opinion but it’s a dumb opinion. You’re allowed to have dumb opinions but I’m allowed to calm them dumb.   As for the people complaining because we’re “wasting government resources” on state symbolism well a lot of that has happened for a long long time. It’s also called tradition. We have state birds and state trees and flags and songs. It’s a part of civic pride and is an important role of government. You might as well be against the national anthem and old glory while you’re at it.   Even in business where time is money they spend lots of time and money on things like fonts logos slogans interior design even to get the right corporate culture symbolism and messaging across. Apple is the way they are and Deloitte is the way they are and they are both that way intentionally. They spent time to make it so that when you see a clean apple with a bite out of it you think about aesthetics and quality and premium pricing and status and fashion but lasting fashion. And same for fedex or snap or Home Depot or whatever. They all spend time to make sure their image reflects their values their value proposition to people etc.   We fly military planes over sporting events to cultivate an image of pride and unity when we have millions of people all tuned in to the same sport. That’s not a waste of government resources it’s a use of them for civic pride and identity.   Declaring a state planet is one action in a long history of civic pride and identity efforts by governments going back to the first tribes who had symbols or flags or tattoos or whatever.   So anyone complaining that it is a waste is not just dumb but wrong too.   So if you’re against it because you don’t like the planet then you’re not wrong that’s a preference you’re allowed to have like preferring the toilet paper to go under instead of over. But you’re dumb because Pluto is an awesome choice for Arizona given all the history between Arizona and Pluto.   And if you’re against it because you think it’s a waste of government resources then you’re both wrong and dumb because it’s not a waste of resources. It’s a valid use in a long history of using resources to establish community with symbols from flags to songs to anthems to fly overs from blue angels to mottos to birds to flowers to to trees and now planet. And you’re dumb for not realizing this is valid and would be valid even in the most efficient organization. Even businesses do this. Even communist countries do this. Even dictators do this. Even North Korea has symbolism. Even monarchies have symbolism. Even tribes have symbolism.   So yeah I stand by it. ','kxf1zgt','/r/phoenix/comments/1brrm3e/gov_hobbs_signs_bill_making_pluto_arizonas/kxf6tji/'

We used to come to the Valley to visit friends and relatives shop pick up supplies for my Dads plumbing business or just hang out. Prescott didnt have much back in those days. I moved here in 78. We were young adults in the 80s. We saw Metrocenter Westridge Superstition Springs Paradise Valley and Arrowhead malls all being built. Now we are watching them all being torn down or remodeled into something else. We lived at 33rd Ave and Bethany in a house with no a/c just a swamp cooler which I dont miss. We spent a lot of time at Christown and the library by Christown in the summer. The last time we went to Legend City was just before it was torn down. We didnt go on many rides because my wife was pregnant. We just wanted to reminisce. We made sure our daughter got to experience everything we could while she grew up in the 80s and 90s. The malls the restaurants Wallace and Ladmo the kids indoor play parks. We miss Smittys and Big Apple and the Mexican food restaurant that was in the Luckys strip mall at 35th Ave and Bethany. And Luckys store. And Mr. Luckys. When we moved to Peoria in the late 80s the Fourth of July celebration was on the football field at Peoria High School. Fireworks food booths games for the kids. Then they built the baseball stadium for spring training on 83rd Avenue. After that all the events like Fourth of July were held there. It became more commercialized. IMO thats about the time the Valley grew up and we started losing the Valley of the Sun character we all knew.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1brxcsg/growing_up_in_80s90s/kxfjvb3/'

Honestly when the CHIPS act came out and I started hearing about the program linked above I was a little baffled. The jobs in question dont really require anything beyond a high school diploma. Youll get on the job training. However I read the link above and since the program only costs your time and $15 (if you pass the certification more if you dont) it might be worth it just to see if thats something you want to do in the future. They might also give you some tips on which companies are in the valley so you dont just rely on the big names.        The number one reason why we lose new hires in the fab is that its uncomfortable. The bunny suit is *hot*. Not that kind of bunny suit and not that kind of hot. I googled to try to find a picture but the images I find are not fully suited up. You have to wear a face covering and goggles. This video shows someone suiting up and his final appearance is what Im used to from the times I did go in the fab.          https://youtu.be/k599RnPq7o4?si=j6dMggO6V2kEylmw      Youll be working 12 hour shifts where you have to suit down and suit back up just to take a bathroom break. The suit is to keep particles out of the fab as they can ruin the product. In addition you cant wear perfume/cologne hair spray/gel lotion make-up etc. when youre in the fab. Theres special paper you have to use (supplied by the company) and some even limit which pens you can use (not the clicky ones and pencils are banned in all fans).      All of that might be worth it to not have to deal with the public though. Depends on you really.      Something else to keep in mind is that the semiconductor industry is currently in a downturn (people overbought during the chip shortage and now the market is correcting) so you might not be able to find a manufacturing job right now. TSMC might be doing hiring/training now in anticipation of opening their new fab in the coming years but Im not sure if that includes the techs or if its the higher levels. Some companies might not have been as affected and might still be hiring. The market will come back but if I knew when Id be making a lot more money...      If youre still interested check out these companies.      TSMC      Intel     Microchip Technology     ON Semiconductor     NXP Semiconductors     Avnet      GlobalFoundries     Skyworks Solutions      At least some of these companies have manufacturing in AZ. Or will in TSMCs case.','kx5v3bl','/r/phoenix/comments/1bqecs2/jobs_career_advice/kxfk9md/'

TBH I was wondering why you were so defensive in all these previous posts. Sounded to me like you were comparing your Asian experience to black ones (could be wrong here). But if you’re raising a mixed race family I’d advise doing a bit more listening than defending. It read as if you were asking for experiences but then actively shutting them down based on semantics or subjective interpretation.   Let me be clear there’s no malice in this observation. But im a mixed race black and white women who’s married to a mixed race Asian and white man. Our experiences are different not only in race but also gender. So I’d recommend considering that as well while you learn more about what your family may experience.

No fundraising self-promotion or spam**  We consider spam not just anything directly promotional but also anything intended to generate interest for a business cause website or effort when the original poster is not a regular member of the community. Since this forum is “About Phoenix By Phoenix” we also consider accounts that mass-post links across Reddit to be spam.    We do not allow any fund raising links or posts asking for money. We also do not allow posts of referral code and similar promotions as businesses have used those as advertising ploys. We also do not allow posts for petitions or signature/name gathering.  If you have rarely (or never) posted in the sub before and your first post is promotional it will likely be removed as spam. The guideline we use is no more than 1 in 10 posts someone makes should be about their own content.    You can read all of the [subreddit rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/wiki/rules).

','I think I look at this from a different perspective than most of the folks on this subreddit but the end result is the same.  I thoroughly dislike the look of saltillo tile. My home had a _lot_ of saltillo throughout the house when I bought it and it did take me awhile to replace about 3/4 of it. The new flooring that replaced the saltillo is much much better looking.  But read again where I said that I **bought the house** that I fully knew had saltillo. My dislike of that type of flooring was utterly irrelevant to the choice to putting on offer on the house. I imagine that is true of _most_ home buyers.  The classic realtor saw is that the three most important factors in choosing a home are:   1. Location   2. Location   3. Location  Ha ha funny yes but its also far closer to the truth than it has any right to be. The primary factors for choosing a house have nothing to do with replaceable appearance factors -- its all the factors that simply can no longer be changed.  Given that if your house was already in a buyers ideal location fit their budget had a workable set of rooms and was in good physical shape then they would have already put on offer on your place regardless of how outdated it looks. Those that commented that it looks outdated? They werent going to buy it *regardless*!','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1brs11t/selling_my_house_with_saltillo_tile/kxgfxvv/'

If its under under 1000 sq ft you can probably find a decent floating vinyl plank floor that will cost you less than $4K including labor. I am figuring around $2K for labor.  If youve got some construction skills you could probably do it yourself. The nice thing about the floating floor is you wont damage the saltillo. Saltillo is considered dated. People are dumb and have no imagination. Im always amazed at all the HGTV shows out there and people cant see beyond cosmetic stuff. Also people are so into trendy stuff. I am so sick and tired of the plank tile trend.

In fact Kia/Hyundai wants owners to add extra Techron to their tanks every 30K miles to help eliminate buildup.

'kxhswsj','2024-03-31 20:13:20','Ham54','1bsqu6b','Are Chevron fuel better than circle k and other gas stations fuel? ','Yes and no. Top tier is good for both Port and Direct injection as it helps keep the injectors clean. I would argue this makes more of a difference than just throwing a bottle of Techron every 5k or whatever. Now it wont prevent carbon issues in a GDI engine like it would in port injection. Carbon builds up on the intake valves because fuel doesnt wash them like port injection (which is also why top tier is good regardless). Some manufactures like Toyota have combated this issue with having dual fuel injection. Direct injection to increase efficiency and port injection to wash the intake valves.   But honestly drive your vehicle and use top tier gas (even Costco). I wouldnt really worry about throwing a bottle of Techron as much as picking a good quality fuel. Take it on the highway once a week or just go for a drive and rev it up (safely). You will have clean injectors and help your intake valves combat carbon buildup because the engine is hot enough to burn carbon regardless of what type of injection system. In GDI you will always have carbon issues but a good walnut blasting isnt a bad idea down the road.','kxhjg9q','/r/phoenix/comments/1bsqu6b/are_chevron_fuel_better_than_circle_k_and_other/kxhswsj/'

'kxhvyfc','2024-03-31 20:38:11','rucksackbackpack','1bso4w2','LGBT Friendly/Oriented Events or Communities','Awesome! Welcome. First Fridays started as a gallery crawl night and now it’s a huge downtown event. There’s a big stretch along Roosevelt Row which is some galleries bars and restaurants.    Grand Ave is the area with places like Novel Pueblo and Halzel and Violet. Grand Ave imo is more old school Phoenix vibe. First Fridays feature a lot of live music art parties storefronts galleries food trucks and shenanigans. It’s an easy event to meet people because it’s so packed but it can be overwhelming at times. Parking is a nightmare. I usually only attend about twice a year for specific art shows otherwise I go hang out during normal times when I can easily park and don’t have to wait in line for ice cream!','kxhsh2j','/r/phoenix/comments/1bso4w2/lgbt_friendlyoriented_events_or_communities/kxhvyfc/'

There was a time that such brands would take the bottom of the tank at the tank farms for a discount if it was available. This made their truck loads more susceptible to debris and moisture contamination.   This is also where premium brands are supposed to add their property additive. Apparently this doesnt always happen and its not uncommon for a truck load of premium branded fuel to go out without their special sauce.

Andhra style try a Biriyani at Biriyani bowl at 91st and Bell. Also worth trying Daawat on 35th Ave. Especially if you want try their Biriyanis or their Cut Mirchi  which is superb but extremely spicy  Slightly bigger and fully vegetarian would be On Bistro.  Chennai Chettinand used to be good before the Pandemic. Havent been there recently though. Theres also a newer place called Urban District at E Bell and 51.  Paradise Biriyani Pointe is also good for their Biriyanis but there are mixed reviews. Haldi on 59th Ave is mild and might suit you if you havent had much Indian before and they dont really cater to Indians who want more spicy fare. Twisted Curry on Mayo in Scottsdale is a quick grab and go place with decent quality. Tikka Shack at Desert Ridge is ok and maybe more tuned for folks newer to Indian food.

Roadrunners games in the coliseum and the first season the Suns played in America West Arena. Ed DeBevics birthday parties and summer day camp field trips to Water World (which seemed soooooo far out of town back then lol).

Born and raised native and have lived all over in major metros and in other countries for a good chunk of my life before moving back.   Our biggest problems is the sprawl of the metro area. Most cities people mention or look to for examples and solutions are significantly smaller sqr mile wise than Phoenix metro and far more population dense.  I am all for public transit but Id prefer more trails or free trolleys and bus frequency for locally here. Also more bus shaded stops on those major arteries and ones that arent made of Iron and difficult to wait at in our summers.    Its really no secret and the main reason driving why Scottsdale wont do it is we get enough theft and emotional drunk people.   If you live here long enough youll experience it first hand. Few people I know havent had their home or car broken into or something stolen out of their yard.   Its been getting pretty bad in some parts. Some folks I know have been robbed at least once a year for decades simply because of where their house is located. Its petty theft often uninsured and usually sentimental stuff that gets stolen. Were not all rich here able to replace that stuff easily. Its also not the rich sleepy neighborhoods that tend to get hit most. Its the popular destination and recreational areas.   More of that is not better and its simply a fact that assorted crime rates rise near transit stops for systems like this in nearly all cities where those systems work well and move lots of people.','kxgkx6g','/r/phoenix/comments/1bsm3qa/i_am_a_public_transit_enthusiast_and_also_ride/kxjfzny/'

The idea that two people each making $10/hour cant afford a house is nothing abnormal.  Thats a low household income and no surprise.  With that income they shouldnt be looking for a house - they should be living with roommates.  Every household deserves a place to live.  However sometimes thats a house and sometimes thats crashing on a friends couch while you save.  The truth about Phoenix is that while housing is more expensive than a few years ago it isnt THAT expensive at all - it is a Moderate Cost of Living city with equivalent incomes.  Phoenix offers high quality of life for many people that like warm weather and picking a poor couple to call out Phoenix as a desert wasteland with unreasonable housing prices is something the NYT should be ashamed of.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bt3ro4/ny_times_why_its_so_expensive_to_live_in_phoenix/kxjjspy/'

Here is my idea for light rail expansion in the valley.','IDK about crime being bad in scottsdale. I have lived in 3 different locations in scottsdale in the last 6 years (2 apartments 1 house) all south scottsdale south of camelback. The world I see is clean well maintained streets. An absence of panhandlers an absence of homeless to find homeless people I have to travel south to Tempe. Then I can find them in droves. At an apartment complex I did have someone take the seat cushions off some outdoor furniture. And I had someone rifle though my (stupidly unlocked by chance) car once. Both of those were from a less well-off apartment complex.   Overall this is par with my expectations of any city tbqh. Outside of some shoddy apartment complexes scottsdale is pristine. I am sure the police push the homeless instead of actually solving the problem laying the problem on PHX and Tempe anyone but themselves. For this reason I am equally sure there will never be a lightrail. The residents know it. It is an unspoken truth in scottsdale that they are overall middle class to upper class and will do whatever it takes to keep in that way. Not as conservative as paradise valley. Not nearly liberal enough to invite lightrail in. And you know what if I am being honest I can want the city of scottsdale to infuse more capital into supporting homelessness in the valley but I can also see their point with the lightrail. In the western US where homelessness continues to get worse everywhere. Scottsdale has managed to create a town without it and recieves the benefits as a result (more tourism).','kxjfzny','/r/phoenix/comments/1bsm3qa/i_am_a_public_transit_enthusiast_and_also_ride/kxjx066/'

'kxkk0dn','2024-04-01 10:20:11','DominicArmato247','1bsvlsn','Anyone replace home insulation?','This is complicated.  It sounds like you have a blown-in cellulose insulation. Depending on the condition you may be able to just blow in more.  A few points:  * Most houses are minimally insulated and would benefit from more insulation new/better insulation and/or new insulation technology. Insulation materials have improved. Even if your home is just 15-years old it might benefit from some changes. * You want to check for things like mold or rodent/pest damage. Phoenix actually has a lot of homes with holes in the roof but because it does not rain often the damage goes unnoticed. Dont just blow-in insulation before having someone check.  Developers are notorious for doing a crappy job on insulation (just enough to pass a possible inspection). They dont care about future energy costs. Adding more insulation to your attic often provides a significant energy savings. YMMV...lots of factors.  Also look into [sun blocking screens.](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Phifer-48-in-x-25-ft-Charcoal-Super-Solar-Screen-Roll-3021117/100550251#overlay) Those are easy to do yourself and work well.

It matters what you order.  As you are new to Indian cuisine many of the flavors will be new to you. How spicy do you like your food?  My recommendation is to ease into Indian food and try certain dishes that are popular with American palettes: 1) Tandoori Chicken - Chicken marinated and then baked in a Tandoori oven or grilled. 2) Paneer (or Chicken) Tikka Masala - Paneer is an Indian cheese used as a meat substitute similar to how tofu is used in Asian cuisine.  Tikka masala is a creamy rich curry.  Dont be afraid of the word curry either it just means sauce or gravy. 3) Lamb Vindaloo - Lamb in a curry that is a bit spicier than Tikka masala but also very flavorful.  4) Aloo Gobi - Aloo means potatoes and Gobi means cauliflower so this is a vegetarian dish primarily consisting of potatoes and cauliflower. 5) Garlic Naan - Naan is Indian flat bread so this would be similar to garlic bread. 6) Any Biryani - This is the Indian version of fried rice.  Meats and/or vegetables are mixed into a rice dish.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bsus69/where_should_i_take_milady_for_tasty_indian_food/kxkvmt9/'

Some days we dont get walks. My dogs are trained on my treadmill for those days.   Swimming is going to be your best friend for summer exercise. Hopefully you have a pool.   Summer in general just sucks for dogs here. I refer to it as our winter. You get less exercise because the weather sucks but luckily its only for a couple months.   Keep them mentally stimulated that will help a ton.   Mall walks Home Depot or Lowes walks (air conditioning) are helpful too for exercise.   My standard poodle is short in the summer for swimming and keeping cool. I go to posh wash dog wash off Union hills and 59th and I love them. They make my poodle look fabulous every time.   The dog parks here are awful and full of horrible dog owners and aggressive dogs. They have also had numerous disease outbreaks at multiple parks recently. I avoid all the dog parks like the plague.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1bt8k5q/owning_a_dog_in_phoenix_for_the_first_time/kxlbunb/'

North Phoenix is mostly families and is more suburban. If you do end up commuting from North Phoenix you might want to look at places off the lightrail or with a convenient park and ride station.

I looked at my old pool route on maps and Sanibel is rebuilding but a lot of businesses and homes are still not repaired or rebuilt. Ft Myers beach is a blend too.  When I was on Gulf shore Dr in Naples doing a complete equipment replacement there was no running water or power still now sure how long it was after I was back and installed all 4 pumps the blower a chem controller chem pumps and chemical crock that they were able to test the equipment. That equipment room was probably the most damaged out of all of the repairs I did.  The rest were mostly just flooded out killing the equipment but that one had all sorts of debris 2 boats stuck on the property and the pool had several tons of sand that they had to have removed','kykqt8b','/r/phoenix/comments/1bynjht/goodbye_rphoenix/kykth7b/'

When I returned home and my goodness Freeport IL wasn’t the way I remembered it after being away it just didn’t have anything to offer me. I visited other states too on that job. I saw up the north east coast.  A year later I decided to go to school in AZ and stayed. This was 25 years ago but no regrets.  Ps I know nothing about Freeport now. It’s still a pretty town.

My parents (dad really not mom) moved us from the suburbs of Chicago to Phoenix when I was 5 cause his doctor recommended it for some reason. I moved back when I was 22. 24 now so 2 years in Chicago city proper almost.   Everything you described I have found to be true. I prefer midwestern people generally and was shocked that contrary to this sub some people like cooler weather. I certainly do. I don’t like the periods of grey as much but it’s not the worst. Chicago still gets 2500 annual hours of sunshine compared to Phoenix’s 3800 but Phoenix is literally one of the sunniest cities on earth if not the largest sunniest city. I never liked it getting too bright for too long (can be a bit blinding especially driving at sunset hours).   I do think about moving to CA sometimes only because I’d prefer year round full greenery and CA seems to offer that. I mostly hate that everything dies in the winter in seasonal climates and AZ plants are semi dead 75% of the year except for spring.','kyj2m6x','/r/phoenix/comments/1byfevb/why_do_so_many_people_from_the_mid_west_move_here/kyl01nl/'

I’m an architecture fan though so I’m very easy to please here.   I also like walkability and even though I do indulge in the luxury of owning a car so I can go to Starved Rock or the North Burbs I generally don’t rely on it like I’d be forced to in AZ.   I’m from Lombard originally and my dad took us out to Phoenix so I grew up there and had my “I can’t be trapped here” moment out there ironically. Chicago is its own bubble and it’s easy to feel like you can ignore the rest of the world for sure which I kinda like sometimes but Phoenix has this “the desert will engulf you magnetically connect you and you can never leave here” vibe to it. It’s like a place where transplants have to be. After all who wouldn’t want to be in PHOENIX!! /s it’s the future /s  I think if you grow up in the Midwest it’s easy to swallow the Phoenix koolaid but personally I just never understood what was in the punch for everyone else. I think the gloominess of some Chicago winter days colored it in better. But the summers of Phoenix and my awareness of what seasonal depression is like (summertime sadness by Lana Del ray made so much sense to me growing up. Definitely not here though unlike in Phoenix) in the summer of all times.   Like to me summer is for actually enjoying life. Can’t do that in AZ unless you leave for vacation.   I’ll gladly be a hermit for 4 months if that means the winter. Winter in AZ can still be 40-50 degrees at times and feels colder somehow especially at morning. Maybe no snow on my car in the winter but certainly a defrost because it’s colder dry air.','kyl2tqh','/r/phoenix/comments/1byfevb/why_do_so_many_people_from_the_mid_west_move_here/kyl3gtg/'

But I can tell you that there are many large national and global companies that have offices/jobs there. The perception of the Midwest by people who’ve never been there is that it’s all cows and countryside. There’s a fair amount of that yes. But any major city in the Midwest will be similar to any other major city with all the same type of attractions. Clubs gyms fine dining etc. I honestly can’t think of anything I can do here that I couldn’t do there. Only caveat being that there are outdoor activities (golf riding a motorcycle etc) that can only be enjoyed for a certain portion of the year in the Midwest because of the weather.

If that is true I can kind of understand why the guy in the video is so mad. The amount of someones life necessary to be tied up in owning horses south of Sunset Point is a lot and they obviously love the animals or else they wouldnt do it.  I think that the zoomer kids are generally kind patient and prepped to be responsible people in society. Which is why the outliers just... they suck so bad.

The Food Court is abysmal lost some major food anchors and may be losing its ability to support higher end pricing and teetering into more Asian.  I love the Asian corner on Chandler and Dobson but the Mall needs to figure out if the have enough Asian already because it could push out the traditional US style shopping. One walk through the hot outdoor San Tan in Gilbert and you know where a lot of the better stuff from Chandler went. Both malls have horrid traffic but San Tan makes no sense because it’s outdoors. Horrid summer shopping.  The City of Chandler needs to start kicking the operator in the pants.

','I left Bloomington Illinois for Santa Cruz California at age 28 to get away from the winters. I also didnt care much for my home town. After 13 years I moved to Connecticut for a better job offer (sure wish Id kept my California house!!). Connecticut was much prettier and the weather wasnt as bad but after 12 years I moved back to Illinois this time a bit further north. While the winters werent any better it sure was pretty: more hilly and close to rivers. After 9 years I reconnected with my first wife after being divorced for 40 years. She was in San Diego but her family was here in Phoenix so thats where we wound up. We traveled for 5 years and lived for a year or so in Atlanta St. Petersburg Dallas and Hartford but we still prefer Arizona. I love the heat! My wife doesnt so much so we spend a lot of time up in Payson during the summer.

What they’re for? This whole project is like half way built if you’d bother to go outside and look at it. I moved here 9 months ago and no walls were up they’re almost to the roof now.   Once the plant is done TSMC will move a couple hundred engineers to train the thousand that work there and every single one of them will be a great paying job that contributes to the back bone of our country. These chips have been and are a national security risk therefore they will be built here. I’m not sure why your emotion has made you so pessimistic perhaps just researching these chips and how vital they are might help you understand why they’ve pushed this so hard. Every time you click on your keyboard that key press is ran through one of these chips and it enables the little letter to even appear. It’s not magic it’s silicon.

Not only can you pack more transistors for compute power but you can design chips to contain more within them to do more things. You can have better sensors for an example. Cameras will get better photosensors to provide better pictures.   Darpa will certainly be using these for their R&D. I would assume power efficiencies for some military hardware is important so 2nm will translate to those items most.','kym68nn','/r/phoenix/comments/1byukdv/tsmc_reaches_deal_with_us_to_produce_2nm_chips_in/kymqjf5/'

The nice people from the Midwest move here (like my relatives and I). The passive agressive cranky ones stay behind (like my other relatives)   Somewhat an exaggeration but Midwest nice is somewhat overrated. People there are very cliquey as most people there met their friends in Middle School or college at very latest (even in alleged cosmopolitan Chicago) Take a drive around Chicagoland and you will see 99% Illinois license plates on the road. I imagine Detroit or Minneapolis would be the same. Midwest is very insular that not a mix of outsiders quite the same as Phoenix.  Compare that to Phoenix parking lot at Fry’s. 40% of license plates will be out of state. You constantly meet newcomers. Is it kinda transit.. well yeah. But you never feel like you don’t belong. If you going to ever live in the Midwest I’d advise to do it no later than college.

Each NBA Each NFL NHL MLB etc etc. Not only did I hate the fact of giving WRITE privileges its very painful to hunt these calendars league by league team by team. ALSO - once ROKT writes these to your calendar you have to delete or edit them one by one. Huge pain point Im trying to solve with [https://TeamCalendar.com](https://TeamCalendar.com) simplicity.  u/livejamie its awesome you did the digging - with all that I still hope youll find TeamCalendar easier and better :)','kynuksn','/r/phoenix/comments/1bynz0l/sports_on_calendars_dbacks_suns_coyotes_cardinals/kynw1ei/'

Then check the menu and specials board for a smoked burger not the other burger a SMOKED burger. If you dont see it complain that youll settle for a pork belly and beer instead. Matt is the brewer and they have won gold medals for beer but havent competed for food...yet. A thick patty cooked all the way thru but pink in the middle because of the smoking process.

You will find times when the Washington or central bus moves you faster than waiting on a late train. You can also buy passes to scan right on the app.   As you said the bus lines extend the reach of where you can go. Add a bike or scooter and you can get just about anywhere in the central city! Just remember buses get stuck in traffic with cars so you need that app to see when they actually arrive and they will run way behind sometimes.','-','/r/phoenix/comments/1byd4ry/public_transit_question/kyobrbm/'

But the funny thing was the voting numbers show a disproportionate number of older voters and those of the southern part of Tempe removed from both traffic/rent concerns.       The numbers also show the opposition spent $2M on adds flyers and door to door campaigns.

We got hit hard by Hurricane Ian a year and a half ago and left for a while spent some time working for a friends company in Phx to try something new.   She liked SWFL better…I liked AZ better we had an opportunity to come back so we did - for now.   I plan to go back to AZ in about 5 years or so. But for now we are happy here.   Reddit shits on Florida & a lot of the hate is warranted. But it’s not such a black & white thing. There are a lot of great people here. There are a lot of idiots too.   Arizona had their share as well. But for me the desert > ocean any day.   I’ve spent extended time in Chicago Phx and SWFL. They all have their perks. I think you’ll enjoy it here. My only complaint is there isn’t much to do by way of nightlife. But I’m married with a baby at home so that life is over for me for the most part.   Enjoy the new chapter. Arizona will still be there if you decide to go back. Life is short   Edit:  The phrase is “the more north you go in Florida the more south it gets”   It means the more north you get in this state the more podunk red & hillbilly it gets.   The people bashing you for saying that are taking it literal.','kyp298m','/r/phoenix/comments/1bynjht/goodbye_rphoenix/kyp39nm/'

','I came from Michigan which is considered the Midwest despite being closer to New England. The politics were pretty progressive teachers were paid well education of all levels was highly prized citizens understood higher taxes for social programs can prevent cyclical/generational issues healthcare was viewed as a necessity that if you dont provide preventatively you spend more providing on a critical care / emergency basis.  Then I came to Maricopa County Arizona. Teachers are so poorly paid they are the lowest compensated in the 50 states. Voters put it on the ballot and passed a measure to increase taxes to pay teachers more recognizing the importance of who teaches the next generation but Republican controlled AZ state legislature said we control the budget and we wont authorize pay increases for teachers. Elected representatives completely circumvented the will of the citizens they are elected to ostensibly represent and voters dont hold those representatives accountable. So now you have unqualified teachers without degrees and pre-certification in the classroom because they are so desperate for anyone who will teach for such appalling low pay that you need to live with roommates.  Then the school voucher program debacle allowed rich parents to use tax dollars to send their kids to parochial/private school horse riding lessons private tutoring etc.  And of course the 2020 Maricopa County Audit by Cyber Ninjas that didnt follow any legal audit precedent or comply with court orders to turn over documents paid for with public tax dollars.  These are just a few of the ways in which Arizona is more gerrymandered than Michigan from my perspective.','kyjbskk','/r/phoenix/comments/1byfevb/why_do_so_many_people_from_the_mid_west_move_here/kyp9krc/'

Florida Turnpike which takes you through Orlando then some other road through Gainesville to Tallahassee where you catch I-10. Stayed first night in Mobile. Day 1 drive was easy. Drove around 700 miles. Second day was hell because of construction outside of Houston and San Antonio. Beware of these 2 cities!! This took forever to get through after driving for awhile. Made it to my hotel in Bourne TX just past San Antonio. Day 3 stayed in Las Cruces. Got there early and just relaxed. Nice little city. Very surprised by how beautiful West Texas is and the same with El Paso and Las Cruces. And now day 4 oh my God. Google maps took me through the 1 lane highway that goes through the mountains. Theres a town called Miami in Arizona! It was a little rainy LOL Ironic! I am not used to mountain driving. I was freaking out since it was day 4 and tired just wanted to get to Phoenix and Im driving on the edge of a cliff.   To recap it was West Palm to Mobile to Bourne TX to Las Cruces to Phoenix. I left on a Saturday but my lease did not begin until Wednesday so I was able to time it just right.   Originally my plan was to take I-40 on day 2 and go through Dallas then onto Albuquerque and Sedona. The more scenic route. I changed my plans because it was snowing on that route in NM and AZ plus Im from Florida. I havent driven in snow in like 25 years. No thanks. Thank God it didnt snow when Google Maps (construction in Tuscan made the route change) had me leave the safety of I-10 to drive through the mountains on Route 70 into AZ. That road was scary. ha ha plus I was puffing on some really good live Rosin. That got me through Texas.   I would take the Northern route if the weather is fine because San Antonio and Houston can be nightmares to get through on a very long drive. Before you leave check for construction & weather. Also dont bring anything illegal with you in Mississippi or Alabama or you might end up like My Cousin Vinny. Both states are easy drives though except for the couple of bridges. Scary and Im used to bridges and lots of water.    Be safe keep your eyes on the road and try to plan your stops ahead of time. I didnt on day one and wound up in a crappy hotel in Mobile. If you do stay in Mobile be careful if you drive on Airport Rd because it is just strange. Good luck and enjoy SW Florida. I almost moved there but Florida is now too crowded for me. Sad. Now I live North of the 101 in a quiet peaceful area.   &#x200B  &#x200B  &#x200B  &#x200B  &#x200B  To','kyoyt11','/r/phoenix/comments/1bynjht/goodbye_rphoenix/kyp9t31/'
