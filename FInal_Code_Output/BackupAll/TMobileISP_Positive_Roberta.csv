'kxey1bk','100%. Good thing we get MLBtv for free. Id he livid paying $150 and still not getting to see my team.',Positive
'kxf758a','I use windscribe. Works for me.',Positive
'kxf9ctx','I’m happy if mine is below 60 (usually closer to 70-80) so I’d say you’re doing just fine.',Positive
'kxffadv','Agree! Tailscale is great',Positive
'kxfx35b','If I can get a steady 350 Mbps or even anything in the 200-350 range consistently I’ll be happy with that especially if it keeps the ping under 60 ms or less. Right now I think it just keeps flipping to LTE because I’m on the fringe of the tower so it gets a stronger signal there and that’s why it drops to 25-50 Mbps and a ping at 70-110.',Positive
'kxfyfxt','They can connect but cannot take advantage of that speed until they update the firmware from what I read. One of the post here showed a new firmware and hes getting 900 + downloads on the gateway. Pretty awesome.',Positive
'kxgbudy','I was happy with my TMHI but I just went back to Spectrum. I originally switched because Spectrum had raised my rate for 300/10 to $80/month and I got TMHI for $40. My new promotional rate (24 mo. price lock) from Spectrum for 500/20 is $50/mo. The actual Spectrum speed that Im getting is 600/24. Plus I got a $100 credit. I could have gotten a mobile phone line free for 1 year with the Internet but decided against it.  My TMHI service was good until recently when it kept dropping for a few minutes at a time to speeds less than 10 Mbps. I also was worried that if T-Mobile had an outage I would lose both my phone and Internet service.  The T-Mobile service on your phone might be different than you get with TMHI. In my case I get poor data speeds on my phone at home but got much better speeds with TMHI. You cant really tell until you try it. I do get 1.5G data speeds on my phone in locations not far from my home.  When you call Spectrum to cancel they will probably offer you a much better price than youre currently paying although the price-lock period might vary.',Positive
'kxgfrnx','That’s cool i hope they do ours here one day an updated firmware like his. ',Positive
'kxh99rr','Yeah I was happy to cut ties with Xfinity.',Positive
'kxhzaa6','Well that three options are good start.',Positive
'kxi2ifj','I use Seattle or Los Angeles server on Nord vpn. Not one issue.  Nord works great with mlb',Positive
'kxidwz8','So I switched before anyone replied and its performing better speed is 25-50 packet loss has been 15% at the highest out of 10 tests. Im gonna keep trying it and see if that might be worth running instead of 5g',Positive
'kxie87i','#3 is probably the most important point for me. Is this not the case for older TMHI plans?',Positive
'kxjc5aa','If I can get this speed or even half of it consistently I’ll be thrilled. I just need it to stabilize enough to be functional',Positive
'kxjw65p','Hey there! Feel free to message us to learn more about Lumos Fiber Internet! ',Positive
'kxk0hlk','I must be in a really good area for tmobile cause i get 350/100 with 0 packet loss',Positive
'kxk79he','Antenna could help depending on what direction the noise is coming from.  You can try to put baking sheets/pans behind your gateway(pointing towards tower) to see if things improve.  Your other stats are pretty good.  What are the lte stats?',Positive
'kxkfv6t','Thank you for the info! Do u think just the router will suffice?',Positive
'kxwl2t7','Good to know',Positive
'kxwr2jn','Those speeds must be nice! We caved and paid Mediacom to run fiber to our house 700ft off the road for $3200 T-Mobile will be a great backup but I only wish I had some of great speeds most of you seem to get with the service.  Was getting 400Mbs down for a moment when I could get N41 with my MIMOs but now only 90Mbps with N71 and B66 on a good day. Then theres depri.....',Positive
'kxwuptg','Ive not had any issues with Google devices and both gateways that Ive used.',Positive
'kxwxmdg','I be happy at least 300 download 15 upload.',Positive
'kxxgk6q','I briefly had a G4AR & 5688W side-by-side a few months back and the Arcadyan got terrible throughput compared to the Sagemcom. Like 1/10th the DL & 3x latency.   My Sag has been just fine ever since getting ~300-400mbit/s & 30ms depending on the time of day (I’m on a high traffic tower I definitely noticed the recent QCI upgrade during midday use).',Positive
'kxxi4zf','As a data point adding that I was B66/N41 now after FW revision seeing B2/N41. Pings are about the same marginally better speeds about the same a little better upload 650/100.',Positive
'kxxsph0','It was worth EVERY PENNY!!! With this model you can put any Sim card in here even if it’s locked to a specific network… I had used Metro by T-Mobile which is common knowledge that you have to pay $25 every time you switch your phone but with this model you can change the IMEI to mimic any cell phone or tablet. You can pretty much mimic any device that has an IMEI and take the Sim card out and put it in there and it will take your normal 5G data that you get on your cell phone and blast it out as Wi-Fi…. This thing is truly amazing and I wouldn’t want to trade it for the world… the thing is I ended up paying full price for this exact type of router but the model that has Dual SIM card slots which was $595 from chestertechrepairs.com.  But then I turned around and ordered this model with the single Sim card and the snapdragon x62 instead of the X65 for $290 plus tax and performance was only about 20% better from the x65 vs the x62… which is still pretty fast… with that model I normally get around 750-800 if the tower not congested. And in between 200-300 Mbps when it’s slow… that is still plenty enough to run my entire home. Just for s***’s and giggles I’ll try to upload a picture here from my Speed Test.',Positive
'kxxu6qa','I just use my Nokia as a gateway and shut off the Wi-Fi in it. Wi-Fi comes from an external Wi-Fi router. My two pixels work great as does my Google Home. Ive had this setup for 1.5 years.    * TP-Link AX5400 Tri-Band WiFi 6 Router Archer AX75',Positive
'kxxueft','When I think about it the upfront money was a little much… But I am only paying $25 a month for the cell phone plan that I am using in my house on the X 62 and honestly I paid in advance for my T-Mobile service which is about $50 a month… both plans get me about the same speed because they are both using the same towers… Also last month I went over 900+ MBs on the X 62 and was never throttled. My step-son is an extreme gamer. This model is so amazing to me because you can lock onto specific cellular bands and it is impossible for them to throttle you down if you are locked into a specific band. I’ve been locked mine into N41 which is the fastest band that T-Mobile offers around here. You can aggregate multiple 5G and 4G LTE bands into one so you can take advantage of the full speed that the carrier offers. What works best for me is if I turn off 4G LTE and only use band  N 41.',Positive
'kxxwxf1','Yeah  not bad at all.  I consistently go down to 3mb down and 1 mb. Up',Positive
'kxyddn0','been happy with tplink deco (mesh) wifi heard good things about eero & mixed things with google.',Positive
'kxylto4','Hey I wanted to comment again to let you know I spoke with T-Mobile tonight and they moved me to a different tower and got my internet back up to speed. If you haven’t called yet it might be worth it to see what they can do for you.   I honestly didn’t expect anything because the chat person first told me nothing was wrong and tried to have me bring my gateway in to have it replaced. I ended up having a different problem later on this evening and needed technical support. Thankfully they were able to get my home internet fixed as well.',Positive
'kxyvzcx','Nah for me it is very very believable',Positive
'kxz766g','I find it extremely believable',Positive
'kxzhn2m','We have 2 pixel 7s and have been using TMHI for 18 months now.  No problems.  We connected the TMHI hub Arcadayn KVD21 to our Google Nest Mesh network via ethernet.  We also turned of the TMHI hub radios using the HINT app.  Both Pixels have been working with no hiccups. FYI.',Positive
'kxzw26b','I bet you’re super fun at parties not complaining as I stated my speeds are amazing. Did not come to this thread for criticism but instead simple advice. There’s a way you could have worded this without the need of putting someone down simply for not understanding prioritization for towers. Learn some people skills. And follow rule 2',Positive
'ky0eeci','I use asus aimesh system and it works great.  (But only when and if T-Mobile internet speeds are decent).',Positive
'ky0h2nz','I cant really say. Sometimes I still get in the 100-200 range but just now I tested and I got 690Mbps. This is thru wifi not Ethernet. I did swap out the Ethernet cable from my gateway to my router and perhaps that helped. Went from cat5 to cat8. I hope you find something that works for you!',Positive
'ky0r5tz','I used a cell booster and it made my 5G signal better but it was unusable. Im perfectly happy with my 3 bars of good LTE good enough for online gaming.',Positive
'ky1082s','I get 7Mbps Down and 800kbps Up its much better than not having any wifi. Good enough for me to game in smaller lobbies or watch Netflix and YouTube',Positive
'ky13brx','Thats what you get for using cellular. Sign up for fiber or cable and be much happier.',Positive
'ky1h66r','Towers have a dead zone around them and it only starts getting better around 3-5 miles away. Mmwave and the cellspots that get installed around town usually help with this',Positive
'ky1np0m','just figured this out haha thank you so much. all the posts i found up until 10 minutes ago were archived so i couldn’t comment anything.',Positive
'ky1vgdr','I appreciate it! Just really wanted to hammer home how little I understand this stuff in hopes that I would get responses I could somehow parse. Thank you!',Positive
'ky1xq57','The good ones are about $250+ if you want one where you can change the IMEI on it and replace the T-Mobile provided gateway. I want to get one but expensive atm.',Positive
'ky266cg','[Try changing mtu size.](https://youtu.be/v2rOWgGuHBo?si=s4UEEwi5LbG3tWcv) in ps5 you just go to wifi settings hover on your wifi name and press options then advanced options (not sure tho). My mtu size is 1430 or 1420. Could be something with your wireless connection. You can try setting your ps5 to only pick 5ghz or 2.4 id try comparing that. I usually get nat 2 and rarely 3 and i have a very good signal to 5g.',Positive
'ky293zf','I had to use an additional router and set the TMHI device to modem only. I actually returned my first one thinking it was busted as Call of Duty 2023 would never let me join a lobby. Hope this helps! Been working fine ever since getting my second modem.',Positive
'ky2kso9','Dont get business they force blocks on you.    If you really want to get around it youll need a router that can connect via VPN or youll need to get a third party gateway that supports it.    The glinet x3000 is a really awesome gateway. It supports connecting to VPN. Nordvpn and others support port forwarding and should fix it',Positive
'ky2tzgj','Thank you. The tech did say there are more ”advanced” routers with business. Then it became a semi sales call. Wish I knew it was protocol related.',Positive
'ky2u827','Thank you. Installing it now. This was a big help since I use cloudflare as a DNS for the website',Positive
'ky2vfpz','Good luck. ❤️',Positive
'ky30lz6','I have a Pixel 7 and no issues not sure if the 7 and 7a have the same wireless but I believe they do.  Which gateway do you have?',Positive
'ky30viy','Both of those are excellent you dont need a new router.',Positive
'ky3g2bg','It worked perfectly. Thanks again',Positive
'ky3g5ka','Of course Im happy to help. ❤️',Positive
'ky3l9w0','PlayStations remote play works fine as-is already. There is no special setup needed to make use of it.',Positive
'ky3njyf','The smart outlet tip is actually super helpful I can have it turn off and back on after say a 5 minute interval. That’s super smart. Thank you',Positive
'ky3nq32','There is a new updated router I would recommend getting it’s free to your current box for this one and ensure they make the correct sim card active',Positive
'ky3o0cc','No. Thanks for the idea though.',Positive
'ky3oace','Hopefully it worked itself out.',Positive
'ky3r9oc','The signal is awesome your tower is probably very congested.',Positive
'ky3syuy','My Pixel works fine for with our Gateway. Its good because our Verizon coverage is shit so I just do wifi calling and its glorious.',Positive
'ky3wtm5','You’re just throttled to death behind all of traffic. T-Mobile wants a great experience for everyone 🤣😅😂',Positive
'ky3yjkk','I’d gladly pay 3200 to run fiber to my house. 😩',Positive
'ky3zxvw','I can see the tower a few blocks away and I get very good.....',Positive
'ky416yr','Eeek...this is where I was two days ago. For whatever reason...way better today. Back to normal.',Positive
'ky442tk','Theres no activation fee and a 14-day free trial period so its worth trying.',Positive
'ky47pl0','I have a Pixel 7 but I normally use my eero mesh routers rather than the built-in one in my Sagemcom gateway. When I do test using the Sagemcom I dont get the extremes that the OP is seeing but it does tend to connect to the 2.4 Gbps WiFi instead of the faster 5.0 Gbps. When I disconnect the Pixel 7 from WiFi and then reconnect it usually connects to 5.0 Gbps.  Otherwise the Pixel 7 gets somewhat better WiFi speeds than my laptop with both the eero and Sagemcom.',Positive
'ky47y1j','Its good.  Way better than mine.    You are also on band 41 which is one of the better ones.  I live in a rural area and my tower only does 5g on band 71.  Which is the low speed high range band.',Positive
'ky48zpe','TMHI is only good in 2 situations IMO.   1) You dont care that much about the internet and only want to browse the web and check email once in a while.    2) You live in an area that has no other option for high speed internet.    Im in the second group.  From 2010 to 2023 I had 3mbit DSL.  Was all I could get.  So I was thrilled to get TMHI last year.  Im getting 200mbit down and 60mbit up.  Im in a rural area so my tower is never congested. Not enough people.    But TMHI still isnt perfect.  Id never use it over cable/fiber.  Its not steady your speeds can vary greatly.  The ping sucks.  And the CGNAT is horrible at times.    Im thankful for TMHI but Ill be switching over to fiber as soon as they finish splicing the terminals by my house in.  Paying double or triple for a solid internet connection is totally worth it.',Positive
'ky4br46','Huh? I think I get better speeds near the tower than far away. As long as I’m not directly under it it’s good.',Positive
'ky4cogg','60/10Mbps w/ a 37ms ping here. It does vary on your location time of day and the amount of users on the tower. There are times late at night where we get 300Mbps down then there are times its in the single digits. Its good for browsing the web and streaming a movie.',Positive
'ky4cpf5','if it doesn’t work then return it. lol in my location it works great!',Positive
'ky4k8kt','3. You live in an area that is well-supported and it’s the cheapest most reliable option.    I had one night of crappy internet that support fixed in a 15-minute phone call but otherwise it’s the most reliable high-speed internet I’ve used and I’ve had it for more than a year.     Right now I have 483 down and it’s peak hours',Positive
