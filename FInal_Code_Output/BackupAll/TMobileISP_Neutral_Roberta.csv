'kxf327n','1984?    In 1984 nobody had internet at home.  In the early 90s people used those big online services like prodigy and AOL but they werent real internet even then.  Just a big online server.  In about 1996 people started getting dialup internet.  Thats when I got it I think.  Another big thing in the  late 80s and early 90s were BBSs.  Youd dial into a server that would have files and messages.  It was all text based.  Most that I ever dialed into used 2400 baud modems.  You know how long it takes to download a megabyte on 2400 baud? lol.    But you couldnt play many games over the internet.  Back then people played games over local area networks LANS.  They ran on the IPX protocol.  The internet was TCP protocol.  I played a lot of Duke Nukem 3d back then.  In order to play it on the internet I had to buy a program called Kali.  It emulated an IPX network over the internet.  Letting us to 1v1 matches.   I think the first games I actually played on the internet was the original halflife and unreal back in 1999.  That is one reason why the original halflife was so cool.  Coud play with random people on the internet.',Neutral

Be nice if the Gateways can access 5GUC but I have read other post that tower upgrades have allowed them to get speeds up to 900+ mbps download. I hope they update my Tower one day.

'kxhdpqg','You can always try it. Theres no commitment and there is a 15 day Test Drive where if you dont like it and cancel within 15 days theyll credit the cost so its essentially free to try.   Three things to keep in mind...  1. TMHI is on the bottom rung of the priority ladder and theres no guarantee that the gateway will connect to the same antenna or even tower as your phone. IOW your speeds with TMHI may be lower than with your phone.   2. If you game the ping may be a problem but maybe not. Gaming experience varies from subscriber to subscriber.   3. Though you dont get cut off TMHI now has a monthly deprioritization point of 1.2TB which means that if you hit 1.2TB within your service month your service will be further deprioritized than it normally is which means you could see a drastic drop in your speeds until the new monthly cycle starts.

As your question is written we cannot be sure if you are talking about your TMHI modem (you mentioned moving it around) or your in home wifi.

'kxxcv8g','First with that gateway the 5G metrics are not reported correctly to either the native app or the Hint Control app. The display will always show 5 bars due to inaccurate information on 5G. It is a firmware issue with that particular device.   4G side looks pretty good though.   It is possible that the tower you are connecting to doesnt have the backhaul. Or the gateway could use better placement in your home. Placement is made difficult with the bad 5G reporting. Can only move it around and rotate slightly in each spot you try letting it settle and run a speed test and observe the 4G metrics. A good way is do it outside first on all sides of your home to remove construction material interference.   Based on the cgi for 4G you could try getting a portable power supply and trying closer to tower and also perpendicular to see if you are on the 5G signals edge.',Neutral

Ive streamed YouTube on my phone just fine with 500 Kpbs and most SD streams happen at 1 mbps.  (Hell general web usage doesnt need more than 5 mbps as most webpages load in UNDER 1 minute at 1 mbps.)  Starlink is also getting over sold so there are customers paying $150 for less than 5 mbps most of the time.  Again dial up access (56 k) averages $20-60 a month.  Its the heavier items like large downloads where you REALLY notice the lower speeds.  (Hell gaming can happen at 1 mbps as long as the latency is low and there isnt any packet loss.)',Neutral

Second person said there were no towers down and was able to get me going again. Not saying there‚Äôs no truth to what you were told but I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was BS. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what she did but I think she moved me onto a different tower. I didn‚Äôt have to reposition the gateway which I thought I‚Äôd have to do apparently not. She did say she refreshed my connection and we also setup a new network.   I‚Äôm my opinion and from my experiences with T-mo customer service it‚Äôs hard to know what is true with them. This is far from the first time I‚Äôve been given two different explanations. Anyway. Good luck man I hope you get it running soon. If not you should definitely ask about a courtesy credit. I‚Äôve never had a problem getting credited for issues like this. After all you‚Äôre paying for something that isn‚Äôt working and that‚Äôs on them.',Neutral

'ky1i3qr','It‚Äôs because I live in a major metro area and a lot more people have gotten TMHI since I first did. The tower is congested the slowdown happened in the AM when people get up and at night between 6-10. Middle of the night I get those 750 down speeds.',Neutral

'ky1uyb4','Youll have Type 2 NAT. You could probably get around this with a weird setup but it would add latency. Its not worth it. Games like Destiny 2 that use a hybrid P2P system work fine on Type 2. World of Warcraft on PC is fine. 50-60ms from Florida to Chicago Datacenter.  So the only thing you can really control is the optimal placement of your gateway in your house for the best connection. The second thing you can control is having your PS5/TV in that same room. If you cant do that for some reason look into a Wifi-Extender with an Ethernet Port (turn the wi-fi off and just use the ethernet) or setup a mesh system.',Neutral

'ky2bt5b','So people don‚Äôt understand 5G is separated into 3 different levels but all show up as 5G but have way different speeds.   First you need to make sure you are on 5Ghz wifi and not 2.4Ghz. Its set to automatically decide which to put you on but its better to separate them into two different ssids entirely.   Second and back to my 5G point make sure you are not on low band 5G. Low band is not very fast. Typically ranges from 30-70mbps. But if you are on 2.4Ghz it will be even slower. Low band channels are n71. If you look at your app and see your channel is n71 then you are on the slowest form of 5G.   What you want to be on is mid-band or best case scenario mmwave or (high band). High band (what i am on) usually is 400-600mbps with around 18-20ms of ping.',Neutral
'ky2d4xy','That‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt ‚Äúre-route‚Äù your device around a congested tower. The only thing they‚Äôre actually doing when they tell you they‚Äôre rerouting is clearing your device from the HLR and initiating a re-register onto the network.',Neutral

In some other cases they will just send you a new SIM card to swap into your current gateway. But them completely doing a new line for things is pretty common.',Neutral
'ky3n734','The speed differences you are seeing is normal. Phone plans on T-Mobiles network are at the higher/highest priorities on their towers while the home internet service is at the lower two tiers of priority. Home internet is using left-over bandwidth on the tower but is deprioritized behind other traffic.   As for the speed issues between reboots that is also common with T-Mobiles stock gateways. A common cause of this is due to overheating as well as just generally poor firmware. Suggestions for that would be to add a fan to your gateway (you can search for examples of doing this non-destuctively and/or with 3D printed mounting etc.) and to setup a means to automatically reboot the gateway at some kind of interval. (Some do nightly others do weekly and so on.) For that you can use a smart outlet to just kill its power at a set time or if you understand how to work with API endpoints it is possible to setup a script to reboot the gateway more properly but will require something on your network to be online to do the reboot request such as a Raspberry Pi or something similar if you dont keep a computer on 24/7.',Neutral
