In 1984 nobody had internet at home.  In the early 90s people used those big online services like prodigy and AOL but they werent real internet even then.  Just a big online server.  In about 1996 people started getting dialup internet.  Thats when I got it I think.  Another big thing in the  late 80s and early 90s were BBSs.  Youd dial into a server that would have files and messages.  It was all text based.  Most that I ever dialed into used 2400 baud modems.  You know how long it takes to download a megabyte on 2400 baud? lol.    But you couldnt play many games over the internet.  Back then people played games over local area networks LANS.  They ran on the IPX protocol.  The internet was TCP protocol.  I played a lot of Duke Nukem 3d back then.  In order to play it on the internet I had to buy a program called Kali.  It emulated an IPX network over the internet.  Letting us to 1v1 matches.   I think the first games I actually played on the internet was the original halflife and unreal back in 1999.  That is one reason why the original halflife was so cool.  Coud play with random people on the internet.','kxbobfn','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1brvhto/port_forwarding_with_my_own_router/kxf327n/',Positive,Neutral

I originally switched because Spectrum had raised my rate for 300/10 to $80/month and I got TMHI for $40. My new promotional rate (24 mo. price lock) from Spectrum for 500/20 is $50/mo. The actual Spectrum speed that Im getting is 600/24. Plus I got a $100 credit. I could have gotten a mobile phone line free for 1 year with the Internet but decided against it.  My TMHI service was good until recently when it kept dropping for a few minutes at a time to speeds less than 10 Mbps. I also was worried that if T-Mobile had an outage I would lose both my phone and Internet service.  The T-Mobile service on your phone might be different than you get with TMHI. In my case I get poor data speeds on my phone at home but got much better speeds with TMHI. You cant really tell until you try it. I do get 1.5G data speeds on my phone in locations not far from my home.  When you call Spectrum to cancel they will probably offer you a much better price than youre currently paying although the price-lock period might vary.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bqdi91/tmhi_from_spectrum/kxgbudy/',Positive,Positive

Theres no commitment and there is a 15 day Test Drive where if you dont like it and cancel within 15 days theyll credit the cost so its essentially free to try.   Three things to keep in mind...  1. TMHI is on the bottom rung of the priority ladder and theres no guarantee that the gateway will connect to the same antenna or even tower as your phone. IOW your speeds with TMHI may be lower than with your phone.   2. If you game the ping may be a problem but maybe not. Gaming experience varies from subscriber to subscriber.   3. Though you dont get cut off TMHI now has a monthly deprioritization point of 1.2TB which means that if you hit 1.2TB within your service month your service will be further deprioritized than it normally is which means you could see a drastic drop in your speeds until the new monthly cycle starts.

It is a firmware issue with that particular device.   4G side looks pretty good though.   It is possible that the tower you are connecting to doesnt have the backhaul. Or the gateway could use better placement in your home. Placement is made difficult with the bad 5G reporting. Can only move it around and rotate slightly in each spot you try letting it settle and run a speed test and observe the 4G metrics. A good way is do it outside first on all sides of your home to remove construction material interference.   Based on the cgi for 4G you could try getting a portable power supply and trying closer to tower and also perpendicular to see if you are on the 5G signals edge.','kxx8lew','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bv1shs/slow_gateway/kxxcv8g/',Positive,Neutral

With this model you can put any Sim card in here even if it’s locked to a specific network… I had used Metro by T-Mobile which is common knowledge that you have to pay $25 every time you switch your phone but with this model you can change the IMEI to mimic any cell phone or tablet. You can pretty much mimic any device that has an IMEI and take the Sim card out and put it in there and it will take your normal 5G data that you get on your cell phone and blast it out as Wi-Fi…. This thing is truly amazing and I wouldn’t want to trade it for the world… the thing is I ended up paying full price for this exact type of router but the model that has Dual SIM card slots which was $595 from chestertechrepairs.com.  But then I turned around and ordered this model with the single Sim card and the snapdragon x62 instead of the X65 for $290 plus tax and performance was only about 20% better from the x65 vs the x62… which is still pretty fast… with that model I normally get around 750-800 if the tower not congested. And in between 200-300 Mbps when it’s slow… that is still plenty enough to run my entire home.

My step-son is an extreme gamer. This model is so amazing to me because you can lock onto specific cellular bands and it is impossible for them to throttle you down if you are locked into a specific band. I’ve been locked mine into N41 which is the fastest band that T-Mobile offers around here. You can aggregate multiple 5G and 4G LTE bands into one so you can take advantage of the full speed that the carrier offers.

Second and back to my 5G point make sure you are not on low band 5G. Low band is not very fast. Typically ranges from 30-70mbps. But if you are on 2.4Ghz it will be even slower. Low band channels are n71. If you look at your app and see your channel is n71 then you are on the slowest form of 5G.   What you want to be on is mid-band or best case scenario mmwave or (high band).

Phone plans on T-Mobiles network are at the higher/highest priorities on their towers while the home internet service is at the lower two tiers of priority. Home internet is using left-over bandwidth on the tower but is deprioritized behind other traffic.   As for the speed issues between reboots that is also common with T-Mobiles stock gateways. A common cause of this is due to overheating as well as just generally poor firmware. Suggestions for that would be to add a fan to your gateway (you can search for examples of doing this non-destuctively and/or with 3D printed mounting etc.) and to setup a means to automatically reboot the gateway at some kind of interval. (Some do nightly others do weekly and so on.) For that you can use a smart outlet to just kill its power at a set time or if you understand how to work with API endpoints it is possible to setup a script to reboot the gateway more properly but will require something on your network to be online to do the reboot request such as a Raspberry Pi or something similar if you dont keep a computer on 24/7.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bve8nd/speed_issues/ky3n734/',Negative,Neutral

I have 4 bars.    Only one tower in my area.  I live in a mountainous region with lots of hills and valleys and trees.  So the coverage is really hit or miss.  I get a pretty nice signal and average about 200mbit on TMHI.  But my neighbor cant get a 5g signal at all.  My house is just in the perfect spot in relation to the tower.   It didnt use to matter as much.  2g and 3g signals really went far and bounced around.  But 4g and 5g have greater speed and a much much worse coverage area','kxyqwo5','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bvcxzh/this_is_unbelievable/ky47l21/',Positive,Neutral

When I do test using the Sagemcom I dont get the extremes that the OP is seeing but it does tend to connect to the 2.4 Gbps WiFi instead of the faster 5.0 Gbps. When I disconnect the Pixel 7 from WiFi and then reconnect it usually connects to 5.0 Gbps.  Otherwise the Pixel 7 gets somewhat better WiFi speeds than my laptop with both the eero and Sagemcom.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bv8jgj/tmobile_home_internet_spotty_on_google_pixels/ky47pl0/',Positive,Positive

Im in the second group.  From 2010 to 2023 I had 3mbit DSL.  Was all I could get.  So I was thrilled to get TMHI last year.  Im getting 200mbit down and 60mbit up.  Im in a rural area so my tower is never congested. Not enough people.    But TMHI still isnt perfect.  Id never use it over cable/fiber.  Its not steady your speeds can vary greatly.  The ping sucks.  And the CGNAT is horrible at times.    Im thankful for TMHI but Ill be switching over to fiber as soon as they finish splicing the terminals by my house in.  Paying double or triple for a solid internet connection is totally worth it.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bw5j6x/be_aware/ky48zpe/',Negative,Positive
