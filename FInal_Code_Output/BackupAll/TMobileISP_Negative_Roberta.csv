'kxey8c0','Oh for sure. That would be a scam',Negative
'kxf1zik','The CGNAT is probably the worst drawback of TMHI.  They use it so they can share IPs between users.  Because of that you cant port forward.   Its way worse than your Minecraft server.  Youd be amazed at the stuff that doesnt work because of it.  And its random.  One day the traffic will get routed to you. One day it will be routed to your neighbor.    Thats why TMHI is only really good for those that have no other option for high speed internet.',Negative
'kxf2qaq','Sadly it really is my only option we used to have spectrum which was nice but lately 3+ outages a month that last 9 hours is insane...',Negative
'kxf6thc','VPNs are hit or miss for me mostly miss. I feel like I have to change servers a dozen times to find one that the mlb hasn’t blocked. Mostly with Nord. I’ve had better luck with surfshark but they don’t have an Apple TV app yet. ',Negative
'kxfwiyf','Unfortunately with the Sagemcom most of the metrics it displays are incorrect my metrics look very similar as are my speeds when compared to yours.  In my case an antenna would help as Im far from the nearest tower.  Take note the Sagemcom also has issues with the LAN speeds over 350Mbps so your speeds with an Orbi mesh plugged into the LAN could be limited to something near those speeds.',Negative
'kxfyryu','Change the cellular selection to Auto 4g/5g and NSA on the 5G network type. Auto or SA do not pass data for me. SA will not work when a static IP is configured. Auto should work by connecting to NSA but that has not been my experience.',Negative
'kxg46vb','They are 5G UC capable (5G UC is just n41). The issue is is that the gateways arent capable of 5G Standalone (at least without a firmware update they arent). Plus the modems inside of them arent as upgraded as most modern smartphones.  Your tower is most likely already updated but the gateways are staying on 5G Non-Standalone mode (LTE + 5G) without a firmware update to enable Standalone.',Negative
'kxg5f03','It doesn’t do that.  It will create a double NAT as the gateway’s router does not have a pass-thru option',Negative
'kxg6cbo','Doesn’t mean anything.  The TMO Gateway has to be in bypass/pass through to avoid double nat.   There is zero reason to use the Asus in access point mode.  Otherwise just add a mesh system to extend the reach of the WiFi signal and save $$$',Negative
'kxg6ds6','They make it as difficult as possible to redeem the rebate and Im assuming a sizable number of customers just say forget it and move on thus T-Mobile saving money.   Theres just too many posts about TMO Home Internet only customers not being able to access their accounts to get the $5 auto pay monthly discount and not being able to redeem the rebate for it to just be a coincidence.   MOST companies cut corners in some way shape form or fashion to save and or make an extra buck.',Negative
'kxgk1zt','When I tried to put SA last time the gateway could not make any connection and I had to do factory reset.',Negative
'kxgkk1r','Hmm it’s going to be hard to troubleshoot without a t-mobile phone to use as a reference. It could be an issue with your line a tower issue or something with the account.  I’m sorry I wish I could help you more',Negative
'kxh6t7x','I see. Add that to the list of reasons I wont switch to iPhone. I have a work iPhone and I get annoyed with it.',Negative

'kxhop8r','Thats what Im doing now and its not helping.',Negative
'kxi0d1u','Ive had nothing but issues. Insane ping and packet loss ruin just about every game for me. Today has been such terrible service that I couldnt even do a speed test. My packet loss today has been from 30-83%',Negative
'kxi17a2','I havent touched I racing because my internet stability is so shot T-Mobile reps say they have no clue when the issue will be resolved. I played Assetto corsa (no hesi) and my ping would register above 1000. Getting race details to load was a longer wait than normal and then other players and AI were rubberbanding. I had to play in a low population lobby so other people wouldnt have issues with my McDonalds wifi',Negative
'kxi73ip','That happened to me a couple weeks ago as well. I called tmo and they said 2 of my 3 towers were down for maintenance with no estimated finished date and that was last week. Going on 2 weeks now with unusable internet',Negative
'kxikfis','Not anytime soon T-Mobile has no reason.',Negative
'kxikrte','You wouldnt happen to have a T-Mobile cell booster would you?  I have the T-Mobile branded Cel-Fi Duo+ and the window and base unit communicate over 5ghz and they interfere with the gateways 5ghz WiFi signal severely.  I cant use it now that I have T-Mobile home Internet.',Negative
'kxin0yw','How do you order the device? I can’t find it anywhere.',Negative
'kxirpl4','That’s crazy because having only SA on I get higher ping than NSA. Let’s say for example I use b66+n41 NSA I can get almost down to 30ms on Valorant but it’s not stable all of the time and I get some spikes. Same thing with n41 SA. So I just use n71 SA but I get like +10 extra ping. It’s like the routing with n71 sucks idk tbh. But it’s stable so that’s all I really care about',Negative
'kxjc1ty','It’s not really about me trying to get the speed up just more consistent. If it flips from my posted speed to below 50 Mbps with a doubling or tripling in ping within 5 minutes then I can’t WFH play games or stream anything consistently or reliably which defeats the purpose of the internet to begin with',Negative
'kxkft38','I have been concerned with the packet loss indicator of Speedtest (I use the app on my Mac).  The packet loss numbers are just plain weird at times.  I mean I have good speed good throughput and good internet experience and Speedtest shows WILDLY random packet loss numbers from 0$ to 79% (for real)  I decided to do my own ping and packet loss testing using a terminal and the highest I have ever gotten was less than 1 percent. I also used another online packet loss tester and through NUMEROUS tests I have never exceeded 1 percent.   Im just not confident in the speedtest packet loss numbers.....',Negative
'kxkjnmv','Just ordered my tmaybe home internet today - before ordering - I asked the rep where the nearest 5g tower was in relation to my apt location - its close by  Crossing my fingers  Its 2024... I cant be rocking 1mbps upload speed over dog shit coaxial cable anymore :D',Negative
'kxkqi0v','tmhi gets last piece of the pie.  It will be slower than phone users.  Also depends on the towers bandwidth also.  Theres plenty that have good stats and still get crap speeds.  I dont know how money is for you but if i was in your situation I would try to stick with  optimum.',Negative
'kxksu2i','Youre choosing TMHI over fiber ? 🤪🥴  Fix your home network/WiFi.',Negative
'kxwkz4x','You have full bars and bad connection?  I know the bars dont mean much but Ive never had more than 3 bars.   What kind of speeds up and down are you getting?  Mine is about 40mbps down 15mbps up.',Negative
'kxwlogi','Even though I get full bars I have around the same as you. Edit: Just want to say I can’t even download a 60GB game on my xbox it’ll take up 2 hours or a little more to finish the download',Negative
'kxwvvbv','Youre lucky. Literally every gateway Ive used has had this flaw. DFS causes the Google homes and nest thermostat to lose their minds',Negative
'kxx1k95','I took the SIM card out of a T-Mobile home internet router and put the SIM in a 5G cellular router and I get speeds of 850-900Mbps on an uncongested tower and around 350-400 during heavy congestion which doesn’t last long. I run my entire house and I’ve never been down to the point I can’t download a video… Cameras multiple TVs Multiple gaming systems Cell Phones and tablets… Bars don’t matter… They lie!!! It’s the speed of the modem in the router. Coming from experience I can’t deal with that T-Mobile box. This new router that I ended up buying has a Snapdragon X65 modem in it. It gets me great speeds even when it says the signal is weak!!! I could NEVER get these speeds with that rec bin!!!',Negative
'kxx55m3','I dont understand myself how it works. Direct connexion via Ethernet to the gateway and I have a 740Mbps download just now. But other times like this morning my maximum download was 120Mbps. I didnt move the gateway its a clear sunny day here Ive changed nothing. Dont get it.',Negative
'kxx8wff','This is weird. My 2.4 stopped broadcasting early this morning. I’m lucky I still have my old ISP for another 10 days before I have to return it.',Negative
'kxxeco0','I had issues in Ohio when storms rolled thru here last night.  I think that is a first time that happened.  Even my TMobile cell phone was slow.',Negative
'kxxep03','Second time Ive seen a post about a Firmware update actually making things worse.',Negative
'kxxwl6t','Funny you say youre having issues I think Pixels might be more affected by dropped packets than other devices.  We have pixel 7s and TMHI occasionally wed both see weirdness happening where things wouldnt load or would load in an odd why while everything else around the house was fine.  I ended up setting up a little script on the router to watch incoming data sure enough theres a hiccup when the pixels have issues. I think theyre just more sensitive.',Negative
'kxy1bct','I had to cancel too many issues with upload speeds dropping out.',Negative
'kxydtq3','also unless you have devices purchased after 2019 youre not going to benefit much from wifi 6/e     all your older devices will only connect to wifi5 (2.4/5ghz) bands',Negative
'kxyfcpk','I have a mesh network set to AP-mode ended up giving the asus ax88u to my brother to replace the isp router. It made me weep inside. Curse you CGNAT!',Negative
'kxynvqs','Imagine being this stupid and thinking “I’m not stupid.”',Negative
'kxyo98t','I think this is a provisioning issue. You should definitely call customer support in. Might also be a defective unit. There’s no way.',Negative
'kxypoxx','ive called many times no fix',Negative
'kxyprjx','how am i being stupid???',Negative
'kxyq6wd','Not agreeing that you are being stupid but signal strength DOES NOT = speed.  As others have said you should call customer care as that’s not acceptable (in my opinion)',Negative
'kxyqt6u','What do they say about it when you call? This isn’t normal',Negative
'kxyquy1','Talk to support not reddit lol.. Mine gets 3 bars and has 100 Mbps With 20 upload Wasnt always like that though but the support should hook you up with a new device or reset the signal to your device .  Absolutely outrageous that theyre screwing you over though',Negative
'kxyqvlu','Bullshit. You probably live next door to a tower and you give head to the CEO.',Negative
'kxyra4p','100Mbps over lan tells me its either a) the cable youre using is not CAT 5e or better because CAT 5 (regular) maxes at 100 Mbps or b) the driver on sat Windows needs to be updated and dont trust Windows to automatically update the driver - you may have to seek that out from the OEM. Or c) the Ethernet port youre connecting to on whatever device youre connecting to Ethernet is only a 100 Mbps port instead of a gig.',Negative
'kxyro0j','Might want to read the FAQ posted here.  Weve literally seen HUNDREDS of posts about people getting 5 bars but less than 10 Mbps speeds -- and an EQUAL number of posts of people getting ONE bar and GIG speeds.  BARS DO NOT MATTER.  SINR and CONGESTION DO.  SINR below 0 means a less stable connection with more speed issues and connection drops.  You need SINR above 0 and yes you can get 5 bars of signal but -30 SINR.  (Which is the worst SINR possible.)',Negative
'kxyrxzu','I dont not have their Internet but I have their wireless and I get them speeds cant even play YouTube  or Spotify and takes forever for Facebook to load',Negative
'kxys083','Thanks for the reply I so want this to be true but I can confirm I’m using a CAT6 cable and a TP Link UE3000C Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter for testing.  Edit: I think you’re right. This makes me so frustrated I’ve been using home built CAT6 cables. Triple checked connections and they look correct verified crimp connectors on ends are CAT6 compatible. Doesn’t matter something must be up with them because I just used a small purchase patch cable and now my LAN speeds are what they should be. Sigh feel stupid but thanks for forcing me to check cabling again.',Negative
'kxyvi35','Even if it’s apparently a common issue I wouldn’t pay 50 bucks a month for what OP describes and would be asking support to do what they can to fix it. I’ve never personally experienced this big of a gap (even while traveling with my WiFi for work) except for the one-time tower issue that they fixed over the phone',Negative
'kxz17jx','You get 1.5?  Mine just complains it’s too cold and takes a nap.',Negative
'kxz1s8o','okay this still doesnt really excuse anything',Negative
'kxz1v4q','they normally say theyd re-route it or theyd just tell me to turn it off and leave for a couple minutes and plug it back in it never works though',Negative
'kxz7xlj','Bro you crying like a little $&@!? Man up take your L and move on. Getting overall emotional over this ain’t it fam.',Negative
'kxz8y5h','I get 330mbps with 4 bars. Try asking them for a different modem/router maybe you got a bad one.',Negative
'kxzeqj0','No you didn’t. That was something that could be done with a plan change. The rep was trying to get a sale. Unfortunately for them it counts as false churn and they don’t get paid on it anyway.',Negative
'kxzk6in','i had the same problems just go into a tmobile store and ask if you can get a replacement and give them your old one if they ask whats wrong tell em you most likely just got a defective unit',Negative
'kxzke1l','Not an issue.  Geez. What in DEPRIO do you not understand?  Pretty sure if you turned on hotspot data it would be similar to HINT because PHONE DATA gets HIGHER priority.  Sides youre STILL getting 200+ Mbps.  Theres folks paying $80 a month for 3 Mbps on a WIRED connection.',Negative
'kxzmqy6','I have similar issues. Different speeds. If I connect to the tmobile SSID I get like 800 down a s 125 up. Have my own router switch and aps... All gigabit and I max at 300 down by 125 up. I had read in a other forum that its an issue with the Lan port on the tmobile gateway... But Im not sure. The CGNAT causes me more issues than anything else with vpns.',Negative
'kxzwgti','Can you imagine waiting one minute for a webpage to load?',Negative
'ky01v7e','mine is the same it will work fine for  a few days then be slow and laggy as hell even with excellent connection.  No real rhyme or reason 3 pm 8 am etc.',Negative
'ky05exp','I get 2 bars and up to 150/200 Mbps. This isnt normal. I second the call to support/go into the store',Negative
'ky07nop','shut up dont lie to us',Negative
'ky0ashf','Hello! I have the newest 5G model the name escapes me right now. It’s either the G4SR or the G4SE. I did a reset last night and my speeds jumped to 500 down. Then instantly the tower disconnected from all things internet phone signal and data for about 2-3 hours. So I’m thinking that was the cause',Negative
'ky0caf8','Im having the same trouble - I frequently have to reboot my router. I was getting speeds of 0.17 Mbps down / 1.42 Mbps up and a reboot of the router brought that up to ~50 Mbps down / 7.2 Mbps up. It even said Excellent on the connection both times so it makes me wonder whats going on with the router. Might contact support soon though were also supposed to be getting fiber soon so might switch to that when its available.',Negative
'ky0h3qe','I checked this morning still no firmware update and slow speed. Called T-Mobile (which I should have done yesterday). I mentioned the storms that rolled through Ohio on Tuesday one of the towers in my area (not the one my gateway connects) is down causing slower speeds on the nearby towers (like mine). So wait for repairs to get done no eta from T-Mobile',Negative
'ky0hdvk','When I called yesterday they said it was interference from the Canadain border and that the upgrade. Didnt mention anything about a timeline for a fix. Claimed there was nothing they could do and that morst were being rerouted through NYC. Check the speed this am and its still giving me NYC servers.',Negative
'ky0i1x6','If it doesnt work just cancel and return it. There isnt a contract or fee to cancel. Go back to your old service provider',Negative
'ky0it7v','This is a problem for /tmobile',Negative
'ky0jup7','Is your phone also tmobile? If so what does it get?  If its also crap that tower is being hammered or under maintenance',Negative
'ky0qlxp','Stores are signing up people who don’t even technically qualify for the service just to get a sale because they’re being pressured into selling the service. This results in people getting congestion and canceling their service. They’ll put in an address for location that can get service and then set the customer up for that address.  I canceled my service and went right back to cable. It was crazy fast when I first got it but over the course of a year it just kept getting slower and slower to the point where I couldn’t even stream at all.',Negative
'ky0zrq3','Yeah somethings not right. Full bars should be at least 500 down in a rural area and 300 in a heavy populated',Negative

'ky13h42','It will go up and down. Ive been doing 30 min or hourly test since switching from COX. Also placement. Anytime between 6-11pm the service is slower because of the number of users. Last night was the slowest results. Upload speed is hit the hardest. I was getting 20 down and 1 up. 30 min later it was 80 down and 8 up. This morning its 428 down and 26 up. Both LTE and 5G signals are full bars. Even at that slower speed we experienced no buffering or quality with all the stuff were doing. We dont play online games though which I read is the main issue with these 5G home internet services. Still Im only paying 50 instead of almost 200 bucks with COX. Even when I lowered it to 150 with cox for slower service TMHI wins for me.  5G RSRP - 78 RSRQ -10 RSSI - 67 SINR - 30 Band -n41  LTE RSRP - 84 RSRQ - 8 RSSI - 75 SINR -24 Band -b2',Negative
'ky1jvw5','quite common problem.  Easily found when using the search function.  Nintendo uses p2p service meaning users are the host for games.  Tmobile uses cgnat.  This means your ip address is the same as other users.  This means nintendo wont work right since multiple users have the same ip.  Only way to fix is to use a vpn service.',Negative
'ky1tol3','The status on the device refers to some combination of signal strength signal-to-noise ratio and a bunch of other metrics that are not disclosed and not combined in a standardised way.  If the air interface in your area is highly contended youll see terrible throughout.  If backhaul links servicing towers in your area is highly contended youll see terrible throughout.  If both of these are true youll see atrocious throughout.  The only way either of these (or network configuration issues within T-Mobiles network) problems will be fixed is carrier-side upgrades.',Negative

'ky2dsm2','You can call support and ask to be switched to a different tower. I asked a ton of questions when I got tmobile internet a few weeks ago. My slowest speed has been 70 megs. Fastest was almost 700. I can see the tower from my front yard.  Also is it near a window?  Cell tower internet isnt perfect and isnt for everyone.',Negative

'ky2kof1','This has been happening all week to my house here in CT. It says connected but nothing loads even when I do a speed test it continuously fails to connect. Happens usually around 9am every morning and continues through the afternoon. Havent had any issues in over a year and this just started happening 🤷',Negative

'ky2oplh','I have nothing but bad luck with TMOBILE in NYC and a few dead spots in NJ. In my home state I get blazing speed from T-Mobile. The coverage is very inconsistent.',Negative
'ky2uqid','You dont have a perfect connection that excellent bar graph is meaningless. You didnt share your radio metrics from the T-Mobile app so we have no idea if the signal is good. Secondly if you want an accurate speed test you should be testing over Ethernet not wifi. Lastly you dont indicate where in your home the modem is. So we cant help you.',Negative

'ky3fe5x','Same man. I was told to bring in my old gateway(I have the original gray cylinder one) and they will exchange it for the newer one that is worlds better. I’m gonna go do that today and try. I hope it’s true. I downloaded Diablo 4 and it took over 6 hours that’s unacceptable with today’s internet speeds.',Negative
'ky3gv1c','The business version of T-Mobile Internet allows for static IPv4 addresses to be assigned to the business-version gateway.  While that does work the downside is that T-Mobile routes their static IP connections by region so the latency on that connection can be higher than average.',Negative
