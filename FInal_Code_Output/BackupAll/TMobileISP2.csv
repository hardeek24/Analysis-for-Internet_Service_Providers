'kxxcv8g','2024-04-03 15:31:01','Hot-Bat-5813','1bv1shs','Slow gateway','First with that gateway the 5G metrics are not reported correctly to either the native app or the Hint Control app. The display will always show 5 bars due to inaccurate information on 5G. It is a firmware issue with that particular device.   4G side looks pretty good though.   It is possible that the tower you are connecting to doesnt have the backhaul. Or the gateway could use better placement in your home. Placement is made difficult with the bad 5G reporting. Can only move it around and rotate slightly in each spot you try letting it settle and run a speed test and observe the 4G metrics. A good way is do it outside first on all sides of your home to remove construction material interference.   Based on the cgi for 4G you could try getting a portable power supply and trying closer to tower and also perpendicular to see if you are on the 5G signals edge.','kxx8lew','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bv1shs/slow_gateway/kxxcv8g/'

With this model you can put any Sim card in here even if it’s locked to a specific network… I had used Metro by T-Mobile which is common knowledge that you have to pay $25 every time you switch your phone but with this model you can change the IMEI to mimic any cell phone or tablet. You can pretty much mimic any device that has an IMEI and take the Sim card out and put it in there and it will take your normal 5G data that you get on your cell phone and blast it out as Wi-Fi…. This thing is truly amazing and I wouldn’t want to trade it for the world… the thing is I ended up paying full price for this exact type of router but the model that has Dual SIM card slots which was $595 from chestertechrepairs.com.  But then I turned around and ordered this model with the single Sim card and the snapdragon x62 instead of the X65 for $290 plus tax and performance was only about 20% better from the x65 vs the x62… which is still pretty fast… with that model I normally get around 750-800 if the tower not congested. And in between 200-300 Mbps when it’s slow… that is still plenty enough to run my entire home.

My step-son is an extreme gamer. This model is so amazing to me because you can lock onto specific cellular bands and it is impossible for them to throttle you down if you are locked into a specific band. I’ve been locked mine into N41 which is the fastest band that T-Mobile offers around here. You can aggregate multiple 5G and 4G LTE bands into one so you can take advantage of the full speed that the carrier offers. What works best for me is if I turn off 4G LTE and only use band  N 41.','kxxsph0','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bv1shs/slow_gateway/kxxueft/'

You could probably get around this with a weird setup but it would add latency. Its not worth it. Games like Destiny 2 that use a hybrid P2P system work fine on Type 2. World of Warcraft on PC is fine. 50-60ms from Florida to Chicago Datacenter.  So the only thing you can really control is the optimal placement of your gateway in your house for the best connection. The second thing you can control is having your PS5/TV in that same room. If you cant do that for some reason look into a Wifi-Extender with an Ethernet Port (turn the wi-fi off and just use the ethernet) or setup a mesh system.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bvu1nk/gaming_on_ps5_with_tmobile_for_a_tech_illiterate/ky1uyb4/'

First you need to make sure you are on 5Ghz wifi and not 2.4Ghz. Its set to automatically decide which to put you on but its better to separate them into two different ssids entirely.   Second and back to my 5G point make sure you are not on low band 5G. Low band is not very fast. Typically ranges from 30-70mbps. But if you are on 2.4Ghz it will be even slower. Low band channels are n71. If you look at your app and see your channel is n71 then you are on the slowest form of 5G.   What you want to be on is mid-band or best case scenario mmwave or (high band). High band (what i am on) usually is 400-600mbps with around 18-20ms of ping.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bvcxzh/this_is_unbelievable/ky2bt5b/'

'ky3n734','2024-04-04 17:38:27','atom0s','1bve8nd','Speed Issues','The speed differences you are seeing is normal. Phone plans on T-Mobiles network are at the higher/highest priorities on their towers while the home internet service is at the lower two tiers of priority. Home internet is using left-over bandwidth on the tower but is deprioritized behind other traffic.   As for the speed issues between reboots that is also common with T-Mobiles stock gateways. A common cause of this is due to overheating as well as just generally poor firmware. Suggestions for that would be to add a fan to your gateway (you can search for examples of doing this non-destuctively and/or with 3D printed mounting etc.) and to setup a means to automatically reboot the gateway at some kind of interval. (Some do nightly others do weekly and so on.) For that you can use a smart outlet to just kill its power at a set time or if you understand how to work with API endpoints it is possible to setup a script to reboot the gateway more properly but will require something on your network to be online to do the reboot request such as a Raspberry Pi or something similar if you dont keep a computer on 24/7.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bve8nd/speed_issues/ky3n734/'

There are times late at night where we get 300Mbps down then there are times its in the single digits. Its good for browsing the web and streaming a movie.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bw5j6x/be_aware/ky4cogg/'

I read about that being an issue with Verizon when using your own router. Just thought I’d call it out in case that’s relevant at all. Good luck :(','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bvcxzh/this_is_unbelievable/ky4cxtg/'

I had one night of crappy internet that support fixed in a 15-minute phone call but otherwise it’s the most reliable high-speed internet I’ve used and I’ve had it for more than a year.     Right now I have 483 down and it’s peak hours','ky48zpe','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bw5j6x/be_aware/ky4k8kt/'
