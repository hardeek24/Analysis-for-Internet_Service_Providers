The network system has been notified that your bill is unpaid despite the fact that it was paid. All a tech is going to do is report that you are locked out for nonpayment just as you already reported. The problem will have to be fixed by someone with more knowledge and administrative access to the system than the drones who answer the phones.  Next time insist on escalating the phone call. The people who answer really only know how to read a script and will be completely unable to solve any problems that does not fit into their cookie-cutter solutions. When they get to the bottom of that script sending out a tech is their stock answer and it gets your call out of their queue (i.e. it becomes someone elses problem). Someone who knows how to think (or is even allowed to think) will have to fix it.','-','/r/centurylink/comments/1bpbm5s/internet_is_down_but_i_can_access_century_link/kwuy0qo/'

Fortunately it can be put in transparent bridge mode and you can continue using your own (superior) router. They typically include their 360 Wi-Fi pods which seems popular with most customers but everything Ive read about them isnt all that complimentary. They work but the documentation is very poor and Quantums only solution for any problems is to swap them out.

'kxfzawn','2024-03-31 13:03:01','BobChica','1bshdl0','Help setting up transparent bridging','First of all double check the model number of the device you are talking about. CenturyLink uses a C3000Z and C3000A for DSL connections but I dont recall seeing any reference to a C3000X. You also call it a C300X. What exactly are you talking about? What kind of connections does it have?  For CenturyLink Fiber the most common router is the C4000XG (not a modem in spite of CenturyLink insisting on calling it one). A C3000A or C3000Z could be used as a standalone router and may have been more common in the early days of fiber service before the C4000XG replaced them.  Transparent bridge mode is only needed for devices that have a router function but cannot be removed because they also bridge the connection from a DSL line or optical fiber to Ethernet for your home network. This includes DSL gateways like the C3000A and C3000Z (which are both only necessary for DSL) as well as smart optical network terminals like the C5500XK and C6500XK used by Quantum fiber.  If you have CenturyLink Fiber service with a passive ONT just remove the router you got from CenturyLink and use your Netgear router in its place with the VLAN tagging and PPPoE settings properly configured.','-','/r/centurylink/comments/1bshdl0/help_setting_up_transparent_bridging/kxfzawn/'

Similar spec products from Plume are about the same price.  I believe Quantum offers them for a zero-cost lease at the moment.  So It‚Äôs only $600 or $800 of hardware you‚Äôre holding.      Higher-end WiFi 7 products are out there but youll have to research to determine if those products allow you to split the SSID which I believe is an outdated model of managing WiFi and is being phased out.         You can check out Netgears top-of-the-line Orbi lineup. Their new WiFi 7  system is $2100 for a three-pack.

Not sure if they route to separate OLTs..  Id assume my area is Calix because of this.. but I dont really know.  I can run a modem level speed test from quantum (pre copper RJ-45) and it will indirectly boost my speeds to where it will look like nothing is wrong.. Same case for reseating GPON plug.  Theres 8 GBPS XGS-PON a few miles down from me and that setup seems to work fine.. My friend has it with a 6500XT SmartNID.  No throughput issues for his plan.

My Axon 5500XK will push full upload throughput if I call a modem speed test (pre copper RJ-45) and or reseat GPON SC/APC plug.  If theres no flow going through upload side it decides to intermittently slow down until I call for another hardware speed test though QF app.  The same thing support does when checking the network.  Indirectly fixes it for a few minutes then slows down again. Support will claim nothing is wrong because they see max throughput though SW.  And I can confirm max throughput on all my devices but it will bottleneck shortly after.  Such an annoying issue. Not sure if it has to do with an Axon ONT firmware bug or conflict of specific OLT since there are people with 5500XKs that have no issues.  Im not the only one in the Orlando area experiencing this on GPON side with 5500XT hardware. Someone else posted here with my exact issue.  Prob a similar hardware stack with CO OLT.

Might be a similar problem. just inverted since your DL goes super low.   Ive seen this when looking up older CL fiber issues.  Call for a speed test over the quantum app via check your network  then run speed test to modem directly.  This is essentially what support does when checking your speeds.  If you get high throughput theres something funky going on with the 5500XK back to OLT/CO.  If its low on both ends.. then yeah its prob just a congested network.  My wireless bottlenecks too right next to router (upload) but theres a bigger underlying issue since even wired speeds get stronger when that network check/modem speed test is engaged.  I think its a firmware bug on the 5500XK ONT itself with certain OLT deployments..  Reseating GPON SC/ACP cord to unit also fixes it briefly but it goes back to low 200-400 throughput fairly quick.  Not all 5500XKs seem to have this issue either. Area dependent.  Not sure if fiber split topology has anything to do with it either.. doubt it  Then again.. you could have a completely different problem.. not sure :(  Edit/disclaimer: I have 4-5 different mid-high end routers up to WIFI7 with 6-7ghz broadcasting and all of them produce the same issue.  Wired is impacted too.. just less often.. As I said that modem sided speed test pretty much Jolts my network into overdrive and everything ends up faster.. annoying :)  Edit2: If the IPoE session time resets back to 0s timeframe then speeds also increase to expected throughput for me..  So yeah.. its 100% QF/Lumen sided on my end.  The WIFI angle makes sense in normal scenarios though..

With WiFi youre basically on your own even if you use ISP owned gear. They can help troubleshoot things but they will never promise specific speeds over WiFi because its impossible. What if you have a 2.4ghz only device and it can only pull 80 Mbps? Thats not the ISPs fault. So you can maybe pull 500 Mbps best case with WiFi 6 and maybe a gig with 6E but again no promises.

The 5500XK shouldnt impact throughput with or without a wired connection.  Resetting the statistics table in 5500XK ONT improves throughput to normal levels and brings the 5500XK more in line with other areas that LUMEN has deployed this specific hardware.  There are likely other techs here that can actually confirm there is no issue with GPON deployments in other states.  Wired throughput will also lag behind and have a very slow ramp up unless this table is cleared if tested directly plugged in via wire.  Ive had wired completely bottleneck over transparent bridging mode and fix by reboot or reseating the GPON SC/APC.  Its not hard to see where the issue is..

I felt the same way you did when I first had my service installed over a year ago and stopped letting the 5500 do the work and only act as a bridge passthrough. I have a calix ONT/OLT outside that converts the fiber to ethernet and then the ethernet feeds my 5500 in bridge and then that feeds my orbis. 0 issues and may be the better way to go for now. Can always call quantum and get a tech out if still no luck and see if they can move you over to a calix and 5500 combo. I had severe issues before my calix move and the tech found my fiber was completely broken and was limping coming out of the conduit and had to run a brand new line. You never know - its worth trying for sure as the service works phenomenally when its set up correctly and in my opinion without using their 5500 the way they want you to use it.','-','/r/centurylink/comments/1bx564k/5500xk_issue_in_orlando_metro_area_faulty/kyh4moc/'

Edit: To clarify I can see the 1701 as extension for 1700 on multi-gig.. I just dont believe they will give the 1700 to everyone given redundancy of 10G hardware.

If you do not have the username and password for PPPoE CenturyLink support can provide them. VLAN tagging is sometimes found on a configuration page named IPTV so you may need to look for it there.  CenturyLink insists on calling the C3510xz a gateway or modem but it is just a plain old Ethernet router. There is no need for transparent bridge mode as you would find on a gateway device that incorporates a DSL modem or on a SmartNID with built in router capabilities.  * Some CenturyLink Fiber areas have already migrated to IPoE which does not require authentication from the router. All of them as well as those that have switched to Quantum do require VLAN tagging though. It wont hurt anything to try using PPPoE authentication even if your area does not use it.

Spent 3 hours trying different things just assuming it was something on my end.  Definitely something on quantum‚Äôs end. Seems that switching from xfinity was a mistake.  I‚Äôm guessing their infrastructure is unable to handle the high demand at night and with them rapidly expanding into residential suburbs the load will only get higher. They promise low latency for gaming in their ads but I am seeing latency between 70-100ms at night when during the day it‚Äôs only 10ms.  Also having packet loss in there. I have a phone number from the guy that went around door knocking trying to sell quantum in my area after they finished hanging the wire on the polls. Will text the guy to see if I get any response I‚Äôm guessing not though. I really hope this is an issue that they are able to fix but it‚Äôs funny because the guy had said ‚ÄúI bet you do not get the promised speed with xfinity‚Äù (I had chosen the 1200mbps plan) and I said ‚Äúyes I do get the promised speed‚Äù and I got it at all times of the day. Even running the speed test within the 360 wifi app will show only ~650mbps for up and down durning this congested time when I pay for the 940mbps plan.

All you need is a standard Ethernet/wireless router that supports 802.1Q VLAN tagging on port 201. Any good quality router sold new in 2024 should support this.  I know that CenturyLink calls their routers modems. They are not. A modem is a device that MOdulates and DEModulates data especially for transmission over an analog connection. Since s gigabit passive optical network (GPON) is 100% digital and no modulation is used to send data there is no modem just a router. The optical network terminal (ONT) isnt a modem either. It is merely bridging the 100% digital optical connection to a 100% digital copper Ethernet connection.  TLDR - Just buy a router and be done with it. A decent quality one from a vendor like Asus or Netgear should be very reliable and is highly unlikely to cause service problems unlike the lowest bidder junk provided by internet service providers.','-','/r/centurylink/comments/1c1ns77/purchase_or_rent_modem/kz53bez/'

Ive scripted out packet loss tests (ping [google.com](http://google.com) regularly via a ethernet-wired device) which while it is not the ideal test since pings can theoretically be dropped the packet lost % strongly correlates with my personal experience with gaming/video calls in the evening and it follows a nearly cyclical pattern of spiking to 10-20% packet loss in the evenings (starting around 4pm peaking around 8pm fading out well after midnight).

We have been tracking them for a couple years testing speeds and taking video screen shots with date/times of throttling- I suggest everyone do the same for a class action.   When it first started we would call to to report that we had slower speeds and the way they would fix would just re-set the modem. Then we would just reset..this goes on and on. Then when I called and told them I was logging all of this and believe they were throttling. I was then told it was a wiring issue and they would send someone out. But if it was deemed that it was becuse of something else I would have to pay for the call $90.00 + repairs?? However we reset the modem again and the speeds came back up so was not a wire.  Our speeds have since been at 6.0 to 35- so getting ready to take legal action.

Link Failures: If a link between ISPs fails or degrades BGP automatically selects alternative routes to maintain connectivity resulting in route changes. 	3.	Policy Changes: ISPs may adjust routing policies to prioritize certain types of traffic comply with regulations or optimize cost-effectiveness. 	4.

Right now pinging a server on the GCP us-west1-b region has a latency of about 85ms (normal).  Pinging two different servers in the us-east4-c GCP region have over 400ms.  Pinging your web site [q.com](http://q.com) also has over 400ms!  A few days ago I was on a phone call (the phone provider uses WiFi): latency / jitter was \*so bad\* that I could not really understand the other person I disabled WiFi and went directly over cell phone --> all good.  Point here is: I never had those issues with the previous provider (normal old cable).  I have also been monitoring local vs remote latency and in general local latency (to default GW after the C6500XK) is fine at about 5ms the problem is remote sites and... right now it seems like you have a link down or a routes issue somewhere (as the problem is only occurring to some places like the [q.com](http://q.com) website).  I work from home I have to use a remote desktop.  Inconsistent latency is a deal-breaker for me if this does not improve I will have to just continue using my old (slower) connection and deactivate Quantum Fiber :( .

CLs TOS lay out their Expected Performance clearly and they define explicitly the median performance for various service tiers. Example 940Mbps service has peak-period median transfer rate of 944Mbps with 3.0ms latency:  https://www.centurylink.com/aboutus/legal/internet-service-disclosure/full-version.html  Latency (the time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another in a network) is also highly variable depending on the network path other providers in the path as well as the actual distance to the destination and performance of the end destination servers. It generally increases with distance of the route between the source and destination and with any congestion on the route and decreases as actual speed increases. CenturyLink measures latency by measuring the round-trip time from the consumers home to the closest measurement server and back. CenturyLink High-Speed Internet customers generally should expect roundtrip latency to most Internet sites in the range from 3-65 milliseconds.   Packet loss (the percentage of packets that are sent by the source but not received by the destination) is also highly variable. The most common reason that a packet is not received is that it encountered congestion along the route. A small amount of packet loss is expected and indeed some Internet protocols use the packet loss to understand Internet congestion and to adjust the sending rate accordingly. CenturyLink denotes a packet as lost if the latency exceeds 3 seconds or if the packet is never received. The Federal Communications Commission‚Äôs 11th Measuring Broadband America (MBA) ‚Äì Fixed Broadband Report provides the average peak-period packet loss for each participating ISP for that ISP‚Äôs speed tiers covered by MBA testing.  That document - available at:  https://www.fcc.gov/general/measuring-broadband-america - reports that CenturyLink High-Speed Internet customers should generally expect to experience packet loss at a rate significantly below 1% for the CenturyLink speed tiers covered by the report at levels unlikely to significantly affect customer experience.','kzzxblq','/r/centurylink/comments/1c6bt9m/for_all_my_msp_people_having_issues_with_latency/l00um0r/'

I should point out that any time you change the wireless settings on a guest network ALL of the wireless networks go down for about 30 seconds which implies a soft reset of the wireless so I didnt think a reboot would be required.  TBH rebooting (or factory reset) was also the offered suggestion when I could not release entries from the ARP cache and if rebooting is required to perform these normal maintenance tasks Im absolutely getting another router.

The point is: if you have an explanation for a failure it is easy to dismiss it as a one time event.

So eventually your CL fiber will just turn off one day and your account will be closed. They should send you an email before that happens... but quite a few people just get a fun surprise and have to contact Quantum to get it working again. There are also some who have said they have negotiated their old CL price with Quantum service. But that seems quite rare.  I would say just ride it out until you get that final email or that surprise of no internet. If that happens and its during business hours folks have been able to contact Quantum to get it working again. They dont need to do any hardware changes unless your are is going to upgrade to XGS-PON then you have to use their SmartNID.  The possible downside of waiting is when they do force the transition maybe Quantum is no longer offering price for life or they have raised their rates by then.

The same generally goes for tech support phone drones. All they have is a script and very little actual troubleshooting experience or skills.  Check status lights and cabling first. Try different ports if the cable checks out. This is all part of network troubleshooting 101.  That being said the C4000XG is not a great router. There are many superior choices out there. You just need to insure that any replacement router supports 802.1Q VLAN tagging on port 201. This can be tricky since it isnt always mentioned in specification sheets and quick start guides.
