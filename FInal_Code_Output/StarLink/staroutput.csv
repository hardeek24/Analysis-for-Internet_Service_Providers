I said 1-2 second drops in connection every few hours or even 20-30 minutes always go unnoticed as the connection reestablishes itself before it can be noticed. Therefore creating the guise of a seamless flawless working connection even if its technically not. However the past 10 days I was getting 15-30 second drops in connection every 5 minutes which means everything I am doing gets interrupted and drops. I get disconnected from games disconnected from voice calls etc. Whereas with 1-2 second connection drops I get no noticeable interference unless its about 5 seconds but still with 5 second drops I dont get disconnected either. My game will lag/pause and voice calls will go silent or sound jumbled for a moment then reestablish. This only noticeably happens every 2-3 hours and is nothing to complain about. Clearly you need your waters testing since you cant grasp the fact that I have had a perfectly working obstructed connection for nearly ONE WHOLE YEAR up until the past 10 days where my neighbor stuck his Dishy near mine like an umbrella. Also you cant seem to grasp the fact that there is no other available option for me or my neighbours to relocate our dishes anywhere and as per OP it was clearly stated we are waiting on our landlord to authorise roof mounting. But please do go on being so obviously triggered by me trying to solve my connection issues with all your multiple hostile comments - connection issue has now been solved - it was my Neighbors Dishy after all.

I work with EMS and healthcare agencies and although the direct DC option is nice it is a configuration that isnt standard or easy to find support/documentation online.  I went with inverter route on the Gen 3 and was happy with the results.  But it irked me that there was so much bulk...  I kept looking at that huge AC/DC power supply with a standard connector on the end.  I ultimately bought a project box some cable glands a cigarette lighter power cord a DC upconverter and some pigtails with the same power plug and built my own DC power supply that is simply a drop in replacement for the Starlink AC power supply.

In the interest of transparency I have zero experience in any of those areas. Id provide some suggestions if I had the background to back it up thats just not my style.  Given the above and the fact that Ive been through numerous panel-style interviews involving a hiring manager and their most senior engineers probably the only thing Id say is this (and its really just generic advice Id give to anyone walking into an interview):  \- a little bit of confidence can be a good thing (carefully of course- dont want it to come across the wrong way)  \- remember that its always perfectly okay when you dont know the answer to something (Ive made it a habit over the years to be extremely transparent when a question comes up and its something I have insufficient background to answer with sufficient precision)  \- be eager to learn where there are gaps- show enthusiasm and the willingness to grow and learn where you might need a little brushing up (youd be surprised how many companies are willing to invest in an employee who is clearly capable enthusiastic and willing to learn)  By no means am I an authority on the subject and others might have some great suggestions for you. Some of it will depend on company culture. Ive been fortunate enough to work for a company that focuses on employee retention provides growth opportunities to those who express a sincere interest in expanding their horizons and has always been more than willing to invest in additional training where required.  It has worked for me for the last 17 years (same employer multiple different roles with increasing responsibility/salary).  Youve got a leg up with the educational background which is fantastic.

'kyijzal','2024-04-07 12:49:00','sebaska','1bxulgs','Watching more satellites go into service from southern AZ.','The satellites are propelled by ion thrusters. Those thrusters are very fuel efficient (so the load of propellant onboard the satellite is good for 5 years) but have a very low thrust. Because every ounce of thrust (or rather tiny fraction of that) takes a lot of electricity.   Satellites are launched together (they are packed in a rocket like a pileof dishes). They need time to drift aparat to evenly fill an entire orbit which is over 40000 km (25000 miles) long.  Moreover they get launched to a very low orbit (well below the operational  one). This is for different reasons:  * Launching them to a lower orbit takes less work by the rocket so more could be carried in a single launch (the rocket can carry more to a lower orbit) * If a satellite doesnt work it will fall back into the atmosphere soon and it doesnt increase debris in orbit other satellites need to avoid. * Due to complex reasons (too long to explain in this short reply) satellites orbiting at different altitudes slowly drift (the technical term is precess) underneath the operational orbits (or more exactly all of them including in operational orbits do precess just the lower ones precess faster). There are several dozen orbits in each Starlink group. And single launch often aims at filling a few of them at once. So the satellite hang around in the lower orbit waiting to precess underneath the operational one they are aiming for and only then raise up. Hanging around and waiting takes no fuel and despite high efficiency of the engines the less fuel use the better.  So in effect between spreading out along the orbit waiting for precession to the proper orbital slot and slowly rising to the operational altitude it takes a month or a few.','kyi22ww','/r/Starlink/comments/1bxulgs/watching_more_satellites_go_into_service_from/kyijzal/'

Dishy is currently mounted on my barn ( best unobstructed view). Any way we had a power surge that tripped the gfci and Starlink was out.  I contacted Starlink just in case it was something on their end. I ended up resetting the gfci and works great now. This was Wednesday. Today I get an email and a shipping notice that they are sending me a Gen2 system. I have been reading through the posts and read that the cable is proprietary and a totally different plug in.  My questions are:   -Can I just keep the Gen1 and hang on to or sell the Gen2 ?  - If cant keep the Gen 1 is there an easy cable work around? An adapter or get the ethernet adapter and utilize that in some way by plugging it into my already existing Cat6.   There is a company called Stargear that sells an aftermarket cable that looks to be the same as the Starlink. It would have the length I need.   The other option if I have to ditch the Gen1 is to move the system closer to the house using a pole and running cable in either direction. One to the power source in the barn and one to the house.','-','/r/Starlink/comments/1afqnay/starlink_is_retiring_the_gen_2_standard_actuated/kyjbarj/'

Hm. Thats not necessarily true.  > fixed wireless microwave and shortwave maybe others  Microwave from Chicago to NYC for example has a few issues. First it has to take a wide path around Lake Michigan. Second TSEs now have to watch the weather constantly to see if there is any rain in the path of these links. When there is an adverse weather event we have to fall back to the Spread line.  But then also microwave is a lot less bandwidth than a fiber link so you have to prioritize. And then for shortwave the bandwidth is ridiculously low so it has its own challenges. Not to mention you have to manage a ton of tower infrastructure FCC licenses etc. Some firms definitely do this Jump and Citadel have an impressive amount of radio towers in the US and in Europe.  You also have the fact that there are no microwave links between NYC and London or Chicago and Tokyo. Or China and hahahaha just kidding. So here youre either using shortwave which is incredibly low bandwidth or youre relying on fiber links. Shortwave is faster yes 10ms +/- some variance for a specific link city to city. But again its still super low bandwidth. So where Starlink plays a role here is for firms that need more bandwidth than shortwave can provide or for firms who dont have the capital required to maintain a bunch of FCC licenses large radio towers etc.  So yes but also no?

So the amount of bandwidth you need the shortwave link to carry is not really that much. Only the most time sensitive information. For example you could simply send a single integer index to choose one option from a gigabyte array of predictions you sent ahead of time a few milliseconds ago.  This is also why Starlink isnt useful for HFT. Its much less bandwidth than fiber while also higher latency than shortwave. Only a narrow window of medium bandwidth and extreme distance and medium latency needs would actually fit Starlink.

After launching 5200 active satellites Starlink is unable to provide 100 Mbps everywhere in the US while having only 1% share of the market. In other more densely populated countries satellite internet would run out of capacity at an even lower market share. What exactly are they going to influence with single digit market share?  My prediction the CCP wont subsidize. They will launch a small constellation of about 1000 satellites similar to OneWeb just to have continuous coverage and use it mostly for military critical infrastructure backup and government (police etc.) mobility. They dont need residential satellite internet internally. If the CCP wants fiber internet everywhere utility poles are setup in China (basically everywhere electricity is available) it can make it happen.

And it is succeeding in reducing the ‚Äúdigital divide‚Äù far more effectively than the RDOP program enacted for the same purpose before it was hijacked by fiber suppliers to improve inner city and suburban services to gigabit while ignoring the DSL and WISP only areas receiving 5 to 10 Mb ‚Äúbroadband‚Äù internet.  And worldwide it is already capable of doing the same giving remote areas the same service as those in the most affluent metropolitan areas have come to expect although it will never be able to get significant penetration into those congested areas unless (as in some cities in the US) the fiber suppliers are so incompetent or greedy that their customers will turn to anything else.  And the reason for the CCP to launch a competing constellation and pressure other nations to use it exclusively will be to filter all content through their (probably AI) censors as they currently do within their own borders.','kykzvy1','/r/Starlink/comments/1bymaqr/how_do_you_think_brics_countries_will_compete/kylnt8b/'

'kylww03','2024-04-08 05:19:00','BeenThereDoneThaaat','1byhpzh','Woke up to no connection.','> Fix ?  First unplug the Starlink Router to prevent short-circuits.  Check the full length of the cable for any serious abrasions insulation damage crimps crushes cuts etc. that may have severed conductor(s).    Inspect each connector and receptacle for bent broken or burnt pins.    Consider the application of a quick spray of [***Electrical Contact Cleaner***](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Electrical+Contact+Cleaner.&crid=1HOMGKTU91AMN&sprefix=electrical+contact+cleaner.%2Caps%2C396&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) both sides of the connection at each end of the cable to eliminate any oxidation buildup.  Consider applying a light coating of [dielectric grease](https://www.amazon.com/dielectric-grease/s?k=dielectric+grease&page=2) to help protect the connection from future moisture condensation oxidation corrosion etc.  Ensure that the connectors are [properly aligned and ***securely*** reseated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/17sw0sd/cable_improperly_installed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).  Finally be certain to ***secure the cable*** to the Dishy-support structure within a short distance from the connector.  A slack length of cable in a ***drip loop*** is recommended to provide ***strain relief*** for the connection.  This will also prevent wind-forces from acting on the cable potentially causing excess tension and unseating the connector.  If present temporarily remove a Starlink Ethernet Adapter (and all third-party hardware) from the circuit as it ***may*** be the culprit.  Perform a ***Factory reset*** (cut power to Router 6 times in a row reasonably quickly).  Power up the Router connect device to Starlink default SSID and follow setup prompts in the App.  If the cable continuity test continues to fail this is when a proactive investment in the spare parts needed to continue troubleshooting ultimately pays off.... by swapping in  - first a ‚Äòknown good‚Äô ***spare*** cable   - if that fails the continuity test next a ‚Äòknown good‚Äô ***spare*** Router (a factory-reset Starlink Mesh Router is a good option)  - if that fails the continuity test finally a full replacement Kit sent by Starlink.  If ***no spares*** are available the situation becomes totally reliant on proper communication with Starlink Support via submission of a Ticket describing the current symptoms and the troubleshooting steps taken (in bullet form hopefully engaging a BOT) to obtain the necessary replacement(s).    To preempt any back-and-forth delays Starlink often requires attachment and upload of the following digital photos  - Face of Starlink Dish  - Cable while connected to mast of dish  - Cables while connected to base of router (including ‚Äòlit‚Äô power LED)  - Router AC cable while connected to power source.  - perhaps a screen-grab of the Cable Ping Drop Rate meter from Debug Data','kylwoi0','/r/Starlink/comments/1byhpzh/woke_up_to_no_connection/kylww03/'

Many of us amazed to have gained access to such technology often ***do not have other viable choices*** and are pleasantly impressed with the overall performance.  The Starlink Dish coordinates a Phased Array using over 1000 small built-in antennas to create beam-forming needed to track one of ~ 5500 small satellites moving across the sky at ~ 27000 kilometers per hour ~ 550 kilometres overhead for just-as-long as it can and then nearly instantaneously switches to the next available satellite... over and over again.  The technology is amazing and uptime is surprisingly reliable.  A number of daily micro-outages will be reported in the Network Statistics [mainly the occasional slight glitch when the beam-forming signal swaps satellites or occasionally encounters an obstacle] but are generally not noticeable during typical internet usage.  However some will cause sufficient latency to annoy a competitive gamer.  Snow is rarely a problem with the snow-melt feature engaged and ***very-heavy*** rain may cause a short outage.  The speeds vary considerably as that beam-forming valiantly tracks one Low Earth Orbit satellite and switches to the next and so on.... but in general are very very good and ***once you stop bothering with constant speed tests*** will generally not be an issue or even noticeable.   Latency is generally well under 100ms and vastly superior to geosynchronous-satellite internet.  Zoom-in and click on your location [on this webpage](https://www.starlink.com/map?view=download) for a ***drop-down*** to select a display of **download speeds or upload speeds or latency** (‚Äúthe metrics indicate a range from 20th to 80th percentile of ***real user data*** from the ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù plan during ***peak local hours***‚Äù).  This means that there is a 60% probability of experiencing these results in a high-demand peak period and closer to 100% probability during all other lower demand periods (when speeds often well-exceed the 80th percentile).  There are no fixed-term contracts to sign no hard or soft data caps nor throttling... but Starlink does reserve the right to curtail extremely excessive data usage.  Customer Support is limited to the submission of a Support Ticket describing the symptoms of the trouble.  Support appears to have limited staffing so response is not ideal but generally reasonably quick and responsive... often resulting in replacement items being sent free of charge.  To further investigate if you have a sufficiently ***clear view of of the satellite paths*** load the Starlink App and follow the ‚Äòguided experience‚Äô of the ***Check for Obstructions Tool*** within the ***App*** to determine a reasonably obstruction-free location.  If disappointed return the hardware within 30 days for a refund of the hardware price. The Starlink Terms of Service also states ‚ÄúShould you timely return your Starlink Kit you will also be refunded for the first months‚Äô service fee...‚Äù','-','/r/Starlink/comments/1bz00dq/should_i_get_starlink/kymmkuk/'

These leases are usually set to 24 hours by default and the router or DHCP server will at the end of this lease period send an ARP request to the associated MAC-Address(Hardware address) of the assigned IP-Address if it is still there.  If the device with the corresponding MAC-Address responds to the ARP request then the DHCP Server or router will renew the lease with the same IP address if not configured otherwise.  Otherwise if the device does not respond to the ARP request then the lease expires and is up for grabs for any new device that joins the network.  Devices can also remember their assigned IP-Addresses and their lease periods hence why certain devices on your network have the same IP as before. While your computers IP address could have been reassigned to a new device and as such it has been assigned a new IP-address.','-','/r/Starlink/comments/1bz1y0d/all_devices_showing_different_ip_address/kyn2b86/'

While your computers IP address could have been reassigned to a new device and as such it has been assigned a new IP-address.','-','/r/Starlink/comments/1bz1y0d/all_devices_showing_different_ip_address/kyn2b86/'

Light not be enough to disrupt the connection but enough to possibly slow it down or increase response times.  I had to move mine from the house to a 4 meter high post down my driveway. Digging the trench and installing conduits for that was “fun”. But since then the only interruptions I get are one from the Starlink network itself which are thankfully pretty rare.','-','/r/Starlink/comments/1bz6ag5/is_this_healthy/kyoi4yb/'

They’ve improved their network a lot over the past 3-4 months.  You’re going to be largely at the mercy of however busy your cell is. Some people are super lucky (lower density) while others not so much. The biggest issue for gaming is the lack of a nice flat ping. Starlink tends to bounce up and down a fair bit (40-150ms) which is noticeable when gaming. But it is generally good enough to game which is pretty amazing.','kyp2mds','/r/Starlink/comments/1bfmkr0/rebooting_daily/kyp8qpp/'
