'kxf1zik','2024-03-31 09:43:45','Slepprock','1brvhto','Port forwarding with my own router ','The CGNAT is probably the worst drawback of TMHI.  They use it so they can share IPs between users.  Because of that you cant port forward.   Its way worse than your Minecraft server.  Youd be amazed at the stuff that doesnt work because of it.  And its random.  One day the traffic will get routed to you. One day it will be routed to your neighbor.    Thats why TMHI is only really good for those that have no other option for high speed internet.','kxbpw7x','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1brvhto/port_forwarding_with_my_own_router/kxf1zik/'

'kxf327n','2024-03-31 09:50:13','Slepprock','1brvhto','Port forwarding with my own router ','1984?    In 1984 nobody had internet at home.  In the early 90s people used those big online services like prodigy and AOL but they werent real internet even then.  Just a big online server.  In about 1996 people started getting dialup internet.  Thats when I got it I think.  Another big thing in the  late 80s and early 90s were BBSs.  Youd dial into a server that would have files and messages.  It was all text based.  Most that I ever dialed into used 2400 baud modems.  You know how long it takes to download a megabyte on 2400 baud? lol.    But you couldnt play many games over the internet.  Back then people played games over local area networks LANS.  They ran on the IPX protocol.  The internet was TCP protocol.  I played a lot of Duke Nukem 3d back then.  In order to play it on the internet I had to buy a program called Kali.  It emulated an IPX network over the internet.  Letting us to 1v1 matches.   I think the first games I actually played on the internet was the original halflife and unreal back in 1999.  That is one reason why the original halflife was so cool.  Coud play with random people on the internet.','kxbobfn','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1brvhto/port_forwarding_with_my_own_router/kxf327n/'

I originally switched because Spectrum had raised my rate for 300/10 to $80/month and I got TMHI for $40. My new promotional rate (24 mo. price lock) from Spectrum for 500/20 is $50/mo. The actual Spectrum speed that Im getting is 600/24. Plus I got a $100 credit. I could have gotten a mobile phone line free for 1 year with the Internet but decided against it.  My TMHI service was good until recently when it kept dropping for a few minutes at a time to speeds less than 10 Mbps. I also was worried that if T-Mobile had an outage I would lose both my phone and Internet service.  The T-Mobile service on your phone might be different than you get with TMHI. In my case I get poor data speeds on my phone at home but got much better speeds with TMHI. You cant really tell until you try it. I do get 1.5G data speeds on my phone in locations not far from my home.  When you call Spectrum to cancel they will probably offer you a much better price than youre currently paying although the price-lock period might vary.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bqdi91/tmhi_from_spectrum/kxgbudy/'

Theres no commitment and there is a 15 day Test Drive where if you dont like it and cancel within 15 days theyll credit the cost so its essentially free to try.   Three things to keep in mind...  1. TMHI is on the bottom rung of the priority ladder and theres no guarantee that the gateway will connect to the same antenna or even tower as your phone. IOW your speeds with TMHI may be lower than with your phone.   2. If you game the ping may be a problem but maybe not. Gaming experience varies from subscriber to subscriber.   3. Though you dont get cut off TMHI now has a monthly deprioritization point of 1.2TB which means that if you hit 1.2TB within your service month your service will be further deprioritized than it normally is which means you could see a drastic drop in your speeds until the new monthly cycle starts. But its not a set speed just deprioritization meaning the speed would fluctuate.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bqdi91/tmhi_from_spectrum/kxhdpqg/'

It is a firmware issue with that particular device.   4G side looks pretty good though.   It is possible that the tower you are connecting to doesnt have the backhaul. Or the gateway could use better placement in your home. Placement is made difficult with the bad 5G reporting. Can only move it around and rotate slightly in each spot you try letting it settle and run a speed test and observe the 4G metrics. A good way is do it outside first on all sides of your home to remove construction material interference.   Based on the cgi for 4G you could try getting a portable power supply and trying closer to tower and also perpendicular to see if you are on the 5G signals edge.','kxx8lew','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bv1shs/slow_gateway/kxxcv8g/'

With this model you can put any Sim card in here even if it’s locked to a specific network… I had used Metro by T-Mobile which is common knowledge that you have to pay $25 every time you switch your phone but with this model you can change the IMEI to mimic any cell phone or tablet. You can pretty much mimic any device that has an IMEI and take the Sim card out and put it in there and it will take your normal 5G data that you get on your cell phone and blast it out as Wi-Fi…. This thing is truly amazing and I wouldn’t want to trade it for the world… the thing is I ended up paying full price for this exact type of router but the model that has Dual SIM card slots which was $595 from chestertechrepairs.com.  But then I turned around and ordered this model with the single Sim card and the snapdragon x62 instead of the X65 for $290 plus tax and performance was only about 20% better from the x65 vs the x62… which is still pretty fast… with that model I normally get around 750-800 if the tower not congested. And in between 200-300 Mbps when it’s slow… that is still plenty enough to run my entire home.

My step-son is an extreme gamer. This model is so amazing to me because you can lock onto specific cellular bands and it is impossible for them to throttle you down if you are locked into a specific band. I’ve been locked mine into N41 which is the fastest band that T-Mobile offers around here. You can aggregate multiple 5G and 4G LTE bands into one so you can take advantage of the full speed that the carrier offers. What works best for me is if I turn off 4G LTE and only use band  N 41.','kxxsph0','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bv1shs/slow_gateway/kxxueft/'

First you need to make sure you are on 5Ghz wifi and not 2.4Ghz. Its set to automatically decide which to put you on but its better to separate them into two different ssids entirely.   Second and back to my 5G point make sure you are not on low band 5G. Low band is not very fast. Typically ranges from 30-70mbps. But if you are on 2.4Ghz it will be even slower. Low band channels are n71. If you look at your app and see your channel is n71 then you are on the slowest form of 5G.   What you want to be on is mid-band or best case scenario mmwave or (high band). High band (what i am on) usually is 400-600mbps with around 18-20ms of ping.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bvcxzh/this_is_unbelievable/ky2bt5b/'

'ky8v8jx','2024-04-05 16:12:26','GJ72','1bwtb5r','Introductory period ends?','If there was a contract then they could engage in a bait and switch but there isnt one so theres no advantage at all for them to lower speed after the free trial period. In fact it would be financially stupid for them to do so as theyd not only lose the business there would be the extra cost of refurbishing a used gateway.   It could be many things...  \- Tower Maintenance  \- System congestion and/or prioritization kicking in  \- Connected to a different antenna or even a different tower altogether  If you havent already try restarting the gateway. If that doesnt change anything put the gateway on a long extension cord so you dont have to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in and then try different spots around your home. Even a rotation in place can make a difference. Remember higher signal strength doesnt always equate to higher speed. I have a spot in my house where I can get better metrics in every category yet the speed is barely enough to stream in 720p yet in the normal spot which only gets two bars my speed is 180/60 on average.   Lastly try foil behind the gateway as a collector/reflector kind of the like the dish on a satellite setup. Like in [this graphic](https://imgur.com/6rsc3y7) looking from above where the foil is grey the gateway red and the arrow pointing toward the tower. I actually hang a foil curtain three layers thick and about a 12W x 8H from the back of the fan I have on top of my gateway. Without it I cant connect to 5G. I folded the top so it has a half inch lip on it to hang on the edge of the fan and cut a slit in the bottom for the wires sticking out of the back of the gateway (power cord and USB fan cord).

These people are going to lose their minds. Then G7 G8 G9 the horror just thinking about it. The G literally stands for generation.    5G is a little higher at 3.4GHz to 3.6GHz but thats tiny when you consider that microwaves go up to 300GHz. And visible light comes in at a range of around 430THz to 770THz. Thats more than a thousand times higher than the maximum microwave – and 100000 higher than 5G.  On a bright note 6G is expected to be another huge leap even greater than 5G. The latency will be 1000 times faster than 5G and 6G will operate at 95 GHz to 3 terahertz (THz). At those wavelengths 6G will also have speeds that are 1000 times faster than 5G.   The biggest problem Ive had with 5G internet is the latency its awful.

The other two parts are spectrum capacity and backhaul capacity.    For spectrum capacity congestion on a specific sector or band of thay sector such as N41 will cause poor download speeds.  To many users on that sector of that tower.  Backhaul capacity refers to the fiber line thats connecting the tower to WAN.  Depending on location this will typically be 1gb or 10gb.  If you have awesome signal but slower data service on the internet gateway while having normal data service on your phone its 100% a capacity issue.  Most capacity challenged areas are capacity challenged on all cellular carriers usually because there isnt a viable land lord willing to rent space for a new site or the state&local government wont allow any of the big 3 to build more sites.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bvcxzh/this_is_unbelievable/kyd0kj3/'

Also being to close on average within 0.15 to 0.2 miles of a tower puts you below the vertical beamforming of that tower so your signal quality will actually deteriorate the closer you get within that 0.2 to 0.15 mile area.','ky4br46','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bvcxzh/this_is_unbelievable/kyd1qbi/'

'kydzqfi','2024-04-06 15:42:49','HowToKillAGod','1bxmb4p','Curiosity about streaming to twitch on TMHI','1. Routers is a problem. As a general rule of thumb you should only ever have one router per internet connection. You can use some routers as simple Switches and/or Access Points for WiFi by not using the WAN port and disabling DHCP. Note that the TMHI gateways are already routers themselves. Plug-and-playing multiple routers together will create a situation called Double (or more) NAT which outside of some homelab situations is never something you want.  1a. Though the whole point of 802.11 is to standardize WiFi manufacturers still kind of do whatever they want. They may add additional technology/features that are only compatible with their own devices. Some may advertise interoperability with other brands also using non-standard features but its little more than crossed fingers.  As a general rule if within your control stick to one brand of WiFi equipment if not the same product line from the brand.   2. WiFi Mesh has come a long way since the first implementations 20+ years ago but the very nature of it means it will always be less than ideal and perform worse than not just a wired Ethernet connection but also worse than a direct WiFi connection (sans interference) to the primary Access Point (or Router for these consumer offerings from Asus Linksys etc.)    2a. Understand that Mesh WiFi networks operate by receiving data using multiple antennas assemble that data and then forward it along to the next node that does the same operation all over again.  Each stop introduces latency and is exposed to its own unique combination of RF interference from its environment to work around.    2b. When you browse the web you likely experience no appreciable difference because web data is transmitted intermittently. The breaks between a web browser sending and receiving requests for multiple pieces of data are more than enough time to make up for any latency on your LAN.    2c. Constant uninterrupted data rates are required for live streaming. When you stream something from Netflix or another service you usually have a fat buffer of data that smooths out inconsistencies giving you an uninterrupted experience.  Live streams with live audiences/chat need as little delay as possible meaning virtually no buffer and much less tolerance.  To use an analogy think of trying to fill a pool with water.  A water hose is an ethernet cord. Mesh on the other hand is a line of people passing buckets of water to each other. Eventually the pool will be filled but not without losses.','-','/r/tmobileisp/comments/1bxmb4p/curiosity_about_streaming_to_twitch_on_tmhi/kydzqfi/'
