I sympathize with reps as they navigate through my questions prodding them for holes in the story. I work in IT so Im just militant about security. --- Karina:  iHola gracias por contactarte con Star+! te doy la bienvenida esperando que tengas un grandioso día.Hablas con Karina y será un gusto estar para ticuéntame iCómo puedo ayudarte el día de hoy?  Me: Someone stole my email address and created a Star Plus account using my email. I would like to unsubscribe my email and delete account. I am located in the United States and cannot use your services. Can you please help me? Your website will not let me do it  Karina: Oh I understand. We are truly sorry that this situation is happening with this account. You can count on me to work together on a possible solution for you. You are in good hands. Dont worry!  Karina: Thank you so much for your kindness! Well in this case we must do a short account verification to help usdetermine the root cause. As first step Could you please let me know the name and email associated to your account?  Me: <email provided> <First Last Name Provided>  Karina: Okay thank you! Could please tell me what method of payment was used to subscribe with our Star+ platform?  Me: I dont know. I just got an email thanking me for subscribing. It didnt give me a reciept.  Karina: Oh I got it! Thanks for details! Well on this situation. Would be possible you please share me a photo or screenshot from this mail you received?  Me: <sent 2 encrypted screenshots of email received with no identifiable information>   Me: When I click on the links it tells me I can not get in because Im in the US. So I had to Google your company to find customer service  use VPN to bypass the Countrys URL wall to let me contact you and enable Google translate to read and communicate to you.  Karina: I understand your situation thanks for details! Well I just verify this information and it looks like someone else from regions where Star+ is available try to proceed with a sign up process on Star+ web page with an email typo however this process was not completed this email is confirming a pre-sign up process using just email and password was done but payment information was not registered yet it means this account was not activated and without a payment method this process was not successfully done.  Me: Great news! Can you still delete whatever information was put in?  Karina: Oh okay! Well on this situation we can proceed with an escalation for delete this information. For this process would be possible you please allow me 2 to 3 minutes while I proceed with this escalation? I really recommend you please keep in line to can provide you a confirmation!  <2 minutes later> Karina: Thanks for your kind wait on line! Well on this escalation process internal support request me proceed with some verification questions about your current active plan on US to can verify this information and proceed with this action!   <Red Flag - this is when I started taking screenshots of the chat>  Me: I dont have an active plan in US. This service isnt available in US.  Karina: Oh I understand it! On this situation Do you have an active account with Disney-+ Hulu or ESPN+ on US?  <Red Flag>  Me: Yes. Im not going to give you my personal information though.I really just need you to delete anything that associated with Star plus  Karina: Okay  we can proceed with this escalation! <5 minutes later>  Me: Any reason why deleting an account takes so long?  Karina:  On this situation I just request this deletion on your Star+ account! With this information this deletion could take 15 days on beig processed on successfylly way! You also will receive an email confirmation about this deletion!  <Red Flag >  Me: Why 15 days? I can go on any streaming service and delete it in a few clicks. Your site says the same for user accounts.  Karina: Oh I understand this situation is a long process due to this case is really special as this pre sign up process was not from your country there are this kind of blocks.   Me: appreciate the case number. I would appreciate an email TODAY that states all the information a contact and reputable email address from the company email address handler. I understand my case is special but I know this isnt a new problem. There are many of these cases.  So Im just very surprised that this isnt something a little more accessible due to the continued scam issue with US emails creating accounts outside of their reach.   Karina: <Case Number provided>.  I really apologize for this situation.  Me: I dont believe it was a typo. I truly am starting to feel this is a source of phishing towards people who arent well versed. Thank you for the case number.  lve taken screenshots of this thread.  I will check in with who regarding this case? Can I call a phone number to check on my case number?  Karina: Oh Sure! You can contact with us and ask for yhis number case if you want you can contact from US with Disney+ line!  Me: Can you email me the official contact information and case information?  Karina: Okay on this email you will find information from which account was deleted and email  Karina: Thanks for your patience and cooperation I apologize again for thi situation and I really hope this kind of situation does not happen again Please let me know Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  Me: I only have feedback for Star Plus. For anyone that clicks on that link provided in the email i suggest a redirect URL that takes them to an US site that can provide an option to submit a concern if they feel their accounts were compromised. I shouldnt have had to use VPN to get your customer service. Not everyone knows what VPN is or how to bypass those walls There are lots of people less knowledgeable than me that would have immediately felt victimized because they couldnt get their accounts deleted by being sent through a confusing loop of dead end pages. Please pass that forward. Thank you.  Karina: Thanks for your help on process and also your. feedback!

LOLOLOL. Autoreply telling me to gather my account number (have none) credit card charged (no idea) ....   AFTER I gather all that I can go to [help.disneyplus.com](https://help.disneyplus.com) which is where most of us started.   Im done. Ive put them on notice. DisneyPlus can just retain responsibility for hosting a fraudulent account but Ill continue to watch all payment accounts.','-','/r/star/comments/q24evi/someone_created_an_account_using_my_email_but_i/kcve6fh/'

They were able to look in to it but when they did they said there was no account under my email.

Chatted with Agent Loren L.  on the Disney+ end to see if they could delete the Star+ account. They ended up telling me that this isnt a issue at all actually and any account registered and had service is under their One ID database system and it s auto generated email to let users know that type of service is available and I had nothing to worry about.. Honestly this isnt okay considering two things here... 1) My personal email was used to obtain registered services for Star+ which is obviously in Latin America to service those wanting Disney+ related programming. I live in the United States not Latin America. 2) The CSR just wanted to brush off a serious security issue as it was nothing and not really look into the matter as a whole or why Im having to chat with them at five oclock in  the morning for something I didnt sign up for and havent touched anything Disney related in close to about 2 years. I just read up on the recent posts from some of you here that suggested to obtain a VPN and request termination of services from Star+. I dont know if Ill have better results but this shows me that I need to likely change emails as I did a recent dark web email scan from Google and my info did pop up from a compiled list dating back to 24 Aug 2023. Im fairly certain this is the cause and unsure how to go about getting my email off the dark web once its there.','-','/r/star/comments/q24evi/someone_created_an_account_using_my_email_but_i/khi6pod/'

Im currently doing a live Chat with Disney+ support. Will edit and update this message afterwards.         Edit - From the Disney+ Rep I spoke to via Chat.         We have been recieving reports about this and its quite hard to control the fact that they come in merely like a registration to create the account. Which sadly they were using someone elses email.  The management is doing the best that we can hence the power to delete data using this form.       There is a way for you to completely delete your email from our database which includes STAR+ Please fill out the form here: http://usprivacy.disney.com','-','/r/star/comments/q24evi/someone_created_an_account_using_my_email_but_i/kiza1k9/'
